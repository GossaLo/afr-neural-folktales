Once, many centuries ago, there was a great King of Denmark, whose name was Hrotyar of the House of Scyld. The Danes were a Viking nation, proud warriors  who built great boats to travel the seas and conquer many strange lands. This King Hrotyar built a great wooden hall, which he called Heorot, or the hart, and he intended it to be the heart of his kingdom, where he would honour the great deeds done by his warriors, and entertain visitors to his Kingdom them with lavish feasts. Every night, while the King was in his Kingdom, great feasts were held here, always accompanied by loud carousing.
In that time, many, many, years ago, monsters still dwelt on the earth. Many people believed that in  the beginning of time some people had incurred the wrath of the gods and been outcast from human society. As time had passed these outcasts had grown into horribly deformed, hateful creatures, who took every opportunity to wage war against mankind, as they were jealous of those who lived by the grace of the gods. In the marshes near the great hall Heorot  there secretly dwelt two such monstrous creatures, one  called Grendel, and his mother. Grendel was as tall as two men, and as broad as four. He possessed enormous strength, and his entire body was covered in hard, scaly skin.  They lived in the murky waters of a dark pond, and would attack lone travellers passing through the marshes.
Grendel had been listening to the merrymaking and feasting going on in Heorot, and he was getting more and more miserable, until one night he decided to pay a visit to the hall. With one strike of his great strong arm he broke down the tall doors, and burst inside, howling terribly. The unsuspecting  feasting warriors were totally taken by surprise, they groped for their weapons and tried to defend themselves. But their weapons made no impact on the monster, their blows just glanced off the green scales covering Grenfel. With his enormous hands the monster scooped up two or three warriors at once, breaking their skulls and their bones, he gathered several of them under his arms and left the hall, taking his prey back to his lair, where he and his mother had their own feast.
A few days and nights passed, during which time Hrotyar and his warriors lamented the friends they lost, and set about repairing and fortifying the entrance to the hall. They tried to find the lair of the beast, but although they could follow the bloody tracks, they disappeared into the murky waters of the fen, and the king and his troupe returned home unable to have heir revenge.
Then Grenfel struck again. The fortifications proved useless at stopping the creature, and once again he appeared impervious to the blows of the warriors' swords and axes, and took with him as many as he could carry.
The King and his councillors decided to set a trap for the monster. A number of his bravest and strongest warriors volunteered to stay at the hall, and wait for the monster to appear again; they were convinced that as long as they were prepared they would be able to defeat the ogre. Hrotyar invited champions from all over the Viking lands to come and prove their strength and defeat the monster Grendel, but none succeeded and all lost their lives in valiant but futile battle. Hrotyar realised there was nobody around who could defeat this ogre, and decided to call a halt to the feasting parties, and the hall was locked up and stood empty. Grendel however had developed a mighty taste for human flesh, and started marauding the countryside in the vicinity of the fens, finding victims wherever he went.
Stories of the miserable deeds of the terrible Grenfel made their way to the surrounding kingdoms and reached the ears of the great hero Beowulf. Beowulf was the nephew of the King of the Geats, another great Viking nation who lived in what is now Gotaland, and whose warrior father had been a good friend of Hrotyar. When he heard of the Danish King's distress, he went and sought permission of his uncle the King to take a troop of his most trusted and finest warriors to Denmark. The permission was granted, and so Beowulf and his troop of faithful companions set sail for Denmark. Hrotyar welcomed them warmly, but warned them that in Grendel they faced an awesome enemy.
That very same night Beowulf and his warriors stayed alone in Heorot. Some of them had dozed off, when they were woken by the noise of the great doors being kicked open, and there in the moonlight stood the terrible monster. Grenfell easily picked up the first warrior charging at him with his sword drawn, tore him in half and bit of his head, gulping down his blood.  Beowulf then attacked Grendel with his bare hands, and a terrible struggle ensued. The two combatants pursued each other all over the hall,destrotying tables and benches. Beowulf' s warriors tried to intervene nad help him but in teh half light of the hall it was difficult to see, and when they did manage to strike at the monster it was as if their weapons just glided off his horny skin.
At last Beowulf managed to get a good grip on Grendel's arm, and the monster, try as he might, could not free himself. He gathered all his enormous strength to try and escape, and eventually, with a deafening shout, he managed to free himself from Beowulf's iron grip, but as he fell away he realised that Beowulf still held onto his arm, which had been ripped off at the shoulder. Grendel howled and fled out of the great door, out of the hall and into the darkness of the night.
The next morning King Hrotyar arrived with his queen and his warriors, and Beowulf showed them his gruesome trophy, Grendel's arm. Some of the warriors followed the trail left by the monster's blood, but again, it ended at the edge of a murky pool of water.No body could believe that the monster could possibly have survived the loss of an arm, and copious amounts of blood, and must have bled to death, so a great celebratory feast was arranged for that night, in honour of Beowulf and his warriors. Both Hrotyar and his queen, Wealhow, made speeches praising the great heroes, and lavished rich rewards on them, gold, silver and precious jewels. Beowulf and his party were taken to a castle nearby where they could enjoy a well deserved rest after their big adventure, while all the Danish warriors carried on celebrating through the night.
Grendel meanwhile had succeeded in finding his way back hoem, to his mother, to their lair at the bottom of the lake, where he died in her arms. She swore to avenge his death, and that night arose from the dark depths of the lake and made her way to the great hall where the Danish warriors were still feasting. She entered the hall unopposed, scattered the drunken warriors and, seizing two of them, broke their necks and carried them off for a vengeful feast of her own.
The news of Grendel's mother's attack spread quickly, and one of teh warriors went to rouse Hrotyar. He had Beowulf sent for immediately, and after a short counsel, Beowulf agreed without hesitation that he would follow the monster's tracks and find her lair and destroy her. Hrotyar and Beowulf, accompanied by a party of warriors, followed the bloody trail to the edge of the dark lake, where they found the abandoned head of one of the warriors taken by the monster. Beowulf, dressed in his ringmail, helmeted and his sword at his side, dived into the water and started swimming towards the bottom. He encountered many snakes and sea creatures on the way, who all tried to attack him, but he fended them all off, until suddenly, he found himself in the grip of a being of superhuman strength and dragged down towards the bottom. Grendel's mother had her long arm around his chest and dragged him down into her lair, a subterranean hall, where she threw him onto the rocky floor. She had picked up a long bladed dagger and tried to stab him through the heart. But she could not penetrate the hero's mail. Beowulf managed to extract himself from her grip and struck her with his mighty sword, but her skin was as strong as his mail, and his blow was rrepelled.
They fought and struggled and Beowulf realised that this female monster's strength was at least the equal of her son's, Grendel. Then Beowulf spotted a sword hanging on the wall, bigger and longer than any he had ever seen in all his travels. He was able to pull it off the wall, and before the monster could evade him, he struck a terrible blow to her head, breaking her neck and killing her.
Beowulf now examined this awful abode, and noticed Grendel's body lying on a bed nearby. Using the sword, he cut off the monster's head, and then made his way back to the surface, carrying Grendel's head and the mighty sword he found as trophies. As he was making his way back to the surface, he could see the snakes and other creatures escaping, as if a spell had been broken by the death of Grendel and his mother.
Another feast followed, and Beowulf and his warriors were presented with yet more rewards and treasure. Beowulf presented Grendel's head to King Hrotyar, as a reminder of this terrible monster's reign of terror, and obtained the King's permission to take the sword he had found in the monster's lair as a souvenir to his uncle the King of the Geats. After feasting and resting for a few days, Beowulf and his band of warriors left the land of the Danes to return to their own homes, leaving Hrotyar and his grateful warriors to enjoy peace once more.

Once upon a time a woodcutter lived at the edge of a great forest with his wife and their two children. They had a boy called Hansl and a girl called Gretl. The family's house was very small, it was just a hut really, and they were very poor, often they had to go to bed without any food. The woodcutter and his wife worried a great deal, and as time went by their situation seemed to get worse and worse.  There were just not enough people around who needed the woodsman's services. "How can we feed our children?" the woodcutter lamented, "when we have hardly enough to feed ourselves."
His wife cried quietly. "there's nothing for it", she said, "tomorrow we'll take them into the woods with us, and we'll lose them somehow. We just can't carry on like this." The woodcutter wasn't very happy when he heard his wife say this. "But what will happen to them, they'll be in danger. Anything could happen, some wild animal might come along and eat them alive!" But his wife had made up her mind. "What can we do? We have no choice; if we stay together, surely we'll all perish. At least if don't have their mouths to feed, we might stand a chance." Quietly her husband consented. He knew she was right, but he also knew that he was not able to take care of them.
Hansl and Gretl were in their beds in the next room. They couldn't sleep either, and because the walls in their little house were so thin and flimsy, they had been able to hear the whole of their parents' conversation. Gretl was terrified. "Hansl", she cried, what are we going to do? Are we going to die?" Hansl was a very clever little boy. Immediately he had a plan. "Don't worry, Gretl", he whispered to his sister, "I'll think of something. Just try and get some sleep, and tomorrow, just act normal. Don't let our parents know that we've heard what they want to do." After a while Gretl did fall asleep, and the little boy lay there waiting patiently. Eventually he could hear his father snoring, and he knew that his parents were asleep too. He got up as quietly as he could,  tiptoed through his parents' room, and went outside. There he collected lots of little white pebbles, as many as he could stuff in his pockets, and when they were full, he crept back inside and into his bed.
The next morning, at the crack of dawn, the children were woken up by their mother. Te only thing to have for breakfast was a little stale bread, which they ate quickly, and then they were off. They walked through the woods for several hours. The parents were very quiet, they hardly spoke a word, the woodsman walked ahead, determined, his wife followed and behind here Hansl and Gretl came. Every now and then Hansl would drop one of his little white pebbles in the middle of the path, or by the side of a rock, or by a tree root. He had almost used up all his pebbles when his father stopped in a little clearing in the wood. "Let's make a fire here", he said. Then you children can have a little rest, while mother and I go into the woods to do some cutting." He made a small fire, the mother gave the children the last of the bread she had been saving, and then off she went with her husband. It only took a few seconds, and the disappeared amongst the trees. Hansl and Gretl sat down by the fire and ate the bread. Then they sat and waited. They waited for an hour, then another hour and another. Eventually they got so tired from waiting that they fell asleep. When they finally woke up, it was the middle of the night. The fire had long ago gone out, but there was a full moon, so they could see quite clearly. He took his sister's hand, and they started walking back to where they'd come from. The bright moonlight meant that Hansl had no trouble finding his little white pebbles. They played a game, who could spot the next pebble first, and the time went so fast and they made such good headway that before they realised how far they'd come they could see their little house. The door was open and they went inside, where their father was just getting up. He was absolutely delighted to see them, and threw his arms up in the air and cried for joy. Their mother too was happy to see them again. It had been very hard indeed for these poor people to leave their children in the middle of that dark wood, and now they were just so relieved that they had survived and that they were back together again.
For some time they lived happily together, but their situation did not improve, in fact things just kept going from bad o worse. It seemed that the woodcutter could never make enough money to keep their bellies full.  Before too long he and his wife had that same conversation again. "I really wish I could change things", the mother said, "but it's just impossible. I just can't go on watching these children go hungry every day. Day in day out." The woodcutter was very sad, he loved his children dearly, but there was nothing he could do or say to make the situation better. He had tried very hard to come up with some ideas to make some more money, but to no avail. They were not the only people in the area who were poor. Everybody was in the same boat. Even though it made him feel very guilty he felt he had no choice but to agree with his wife again. Just like the previous time, Hansl had been wide awake and had heard every word they had spoken. Hansl stayed awake until he could hear his father snoring, then he crept quietly through his parents' room, to go out the door, but to his consternation the door was locked. This door was the only way out of the little house, so there was nothing to do for the poor boy but to crawl back into his bed, and think of something else that would help him and his little sister to find their way back home.
The next morning the children were woken up very early by their mother. For breakfast there was only some stale bread and they ate it quickly, except for Hansl. He didn't eat his bread but stuffed it in his pockets. They set out again, the woodcutter leading the way, followed by his wife and the children trailing behind. Every now and then Hansl would drop a bread crumb, as he had done before with the pebbles. In the middle of the path, next to a rock, or by the side of the root of a tree. By and by they arrived at a clearing in the wood, and the woodcutter started a fire, "You children have a little rest here", he said, "while mother and I go to cut some wood." Mother gave the children the last few bits of the stale bread she had been saving, and off they went.   Very quickly the trees swallowed them, and the children were left alone. Hey ate the bead, and waited. They waited an hour, then another hour and then another hour. Eventually the waiting tired them out and they fell asleep. When they woke up it was the middle of the night. Hansl took his little sister's hand, and they started back the way they had come. But to his consternation, Hansl couldn't find the breadcrumbs he had dropped so diligently. He realised the birds must have eaten them. The children tried to remember which way they had come. They walked this way a little, then that way, then another way yet, and they soon realised they were hopelessly lost. But they kept walking, as there was nothing else to do. Hansl was sure they'd find somebody who would help them.
They walked until they were so tired they just fell asleep were the stood, then carried n walking. Now and then they found some berries and nuts that they could eat, but it was very little and they got more and more hungry. Before long they lost all sense of time. They had no idea how any days and nights they had wandered through these woods, when suddenly they came upon a most extraordinary little house in the middle of a small clearing. They couldn't believe their eyes, they house appeared to have been constructed from loaves of bread, cakes, fruit pies, biscuits and candy. They ran up to it and just started tearing bits of the delicacies from the walls of the little house. They were so hungry they never stopped to think what they were doing, and they stuffed their mouths, when suddenly they heard a loud croaky voice: "Nibbly gwibbly gnawsy, who's that chomping at my housey?"
The front door, covered in huge gingerbread men,  opened, and their stood a little grey woman, older than anybody the children had ever see. Her back was crooked, and she had a great big knobbly nose, and hairs were growing out of her chin. Her teeth were as black as charcoal, and her face and her hands were covered in wrinkles. At first Hansl and Gretl were frightened by this apparition, but the old lady spoke, and she appeared o be quite friendly. "Children, children", she croaked. "Wellcome to my humble little abode, why don't you darlings come inside and I'll treat you to some milk and pancakes." The children were delighted to hear this, and they stepped inside. The old lady sat them at a table and poured them some delicious cold milk. The table was covered with goodies. They ate and ate until their stomachs couldn't take any more. The old lady showed them into a little bedroom, with two lovely beds, with soft mattresses and quilted covers. Before they could say "Goodnight" they were fast asleep.
When Hansl woke up, he tried to sit up but he bumped his head on something. He realised he was inside a cage! The floor was wood, so was the ceiling, and three sides. One side was a metal door with bars, which was locked with a giant padlock! He shook his head, was he dreaming? He shouted: "Help! Help! Gretl, where are you?"
Just then, Gretl was still in bed, but the old woman had come into her room, and was shaking her roughly. "Wake up, wake up, you lazy little slut. Time to get up and do some work!" She pulled Gretl out of the bed, and handed her a broom. "Start sweeping!" she commanded. It now became obvious to the children that this old woman, who had been so kind to them the previous evening, was an old witch, and a very bad one at that. Gretl was made to work all day long, she had to sweep and scrub the floors, she had to clean the windows and wash the curtains, she had to prepare food and cook it. Then she had to scour al the pots and pans, the plates and cups and knives and forks. She had to weed the path outside and water the plants. She wasn't allowed to rest for a minute. At the end of the day, just before she fell asleep because she was so exhausted, the witch would throw her a few scraps of food to eat. But Hansl was treated very well. Apart from being locked up in his cage, that is. Every few minutes the witch would bring him something to eat. Some buttered bread and cheese one minute, sausages in gravy the next, apples and pears, carrots and beets. He hardly had time to digest the morsels the witch fed him, when the next one came along. The witch would stand by his cage and watch him, to make sure he ate every last bite of the food she gave him. She'd stand there, bent over, watching him and giggling. "Eat, my little sweet one", she'd croak, "eat and get fat! Heha heha heha!"
Very rarely did the children get an opportunity to talk to each other. The witch was always ordering Gretl about, as soon as she'd finish one job, the witch would give her another one. And when she wasn't ordering Gretl about, she was in front of Hansl's cage, feeding him, fattening him up. She'd order him to stick a finger out through the bars, and she'd feel it and inspect it. When Gretl saw this she realised what the witch was doing. She was fattening up her brother to eat him, and she was checking his finger to see how fat he was getting! She knew it was up to her to rescue him, because he was totally powerless, locked up in that cage with the metal bars and the padlock. The key was hidden under the witch's mattress, it was impossible to get near there without being seen. She came up with a clever little plan to gain some time. She found a little stick, and one minute, when the witch was having her supper, she slipped it into the cage, and told Hansl to stick it out next time the witch came to check his finger. Gretl had noticed that the witch's eyesight wasn't very good. She knew they wouldn't be able to fool her for very long, but she just needed to buy some time to come up with a good plan!
The plan with the little stick worked quite well. The witch didn't realise she was being fooled; she'd feel the thin stick, and mutter to herself. "A little bit more, a few more days, a few more pounds. Heha, heha, heha!" Weeks and weeks went by, and eventually the witch lost patience. The boy just wasn't putting on any weight! She had enough. She called out to Gretl. "Fetch me some firewood", she said. "I'm going to light the oven and roast that stupid brother of yours, skinny or not! I can't wait any longer, I've just gotta eat him!"
Gretl came back with a bunch of firewood. The witch opened the oven door, and told Gretl to put the firewood inside. Gretl pushed the wood as far back into the oven as it would go, then stood back. "Well?!" shouted the witch. "What are you waiting for? Light it up!" Gretl knew very well how to light the wood in the oven, she'd seen the witch do it several times, but she pretended to be dum. "How do you o that?" she asked in a little girl voice. The witch threw her arms in the air and cursed her. "Oh bother, I'll do it myself", she said. She picked up one of the big matches she used for this job, and stuck her head inside the oven door. Gretl had really pushed the wood all the way back, so the witch had to lean all the way into the oven. Gretl quickly took her chance, lifted up the witch's legs and pushed her all the way into the oven, and then quickly shut the oven door on her. Gretl quickly ran into the witch's bedroom and got the key. She opened up Hansl's cage, and the boy had got so fat the he only just about managed to crawl out. "Well done sis!" he cried. They could hear the witch kicking against the inside of the oven door, and they could just about hear her croaking voice pleading with them to let her out. "I'll be kind to you again", she cried, "just wait and see, I can be a very nice old witch!" But the children left her where she was, and started looking through all the witch's cupboards and chests of drawers to see if they could find anything useful for their journey before they escaped from that horrible place.  To their great surprise they found bags full of gold coins and precious stones. They carried as much as they could out of the house and started walking away, glad to still be alive.
As they walked along the path away from the horrible witch's house, some birds flew done from the trees, and asked what had happened to the wicked witch. "She's locked up in the oven" said Gretl, "I think she'll be in there for some time!" The birds were very happy. They had always been scared of the witch who used to like to catch birds and eat them. To show their gratitude to Hansl and Gretl, they guided them all the way home. When the children got home their parents were so happy to see them that they cried tears of joy. They hugged and kissed each of them in turn, and promised the children that whatever happened, however poor they might be, they would never try to get rid of them again. Hansl then gave his father the bag full of gold coins and precious stones he'd carried all the way back with him. "Look father", he said, "Look what we found, we'll never have to be poor again!" And so it happened. The woodcutter was able to build a nice big house for his family, and they now were rich enough to buy all the food they needed for the rest of their lives!

Jupiter was the king of heaven and earth and the big boss of all the gods of Mount Olympus. Every now and then, when they were not busy making up new rules for people to live by, the gods would think up little games to amuse themselves. So it was that one day Jupiter called together all the animals and proclaimed that he would give a prize to the one who produced the most beautiful offspring. All the animals were very excited, so off home they ran and jumped and skipped and slithered and flew and swam to get their babies to be judged by the great Jupiter.
Ma monkey brought her baby along, its hair hadn't started growing yet, its eyes were still closed, and its nose was as flat as a pancake. When the gods saw this poor little creature they all instantaneously burst out laughing uncontrollably, they just couldn't help themselves. But Ma monkey didn't take any notice. She gave her little baby a cuddle, and planted a big kiss on its flat nose. "You gods can laugh as much as you like," she said, "and I don't care who gets the prize, but as far as I'm concerned, my baby will always be the most beautiful baby of them all!"
AesopIt was always the custom that whenever the gods had a reason to celebrate they would invite all and sundry to the party. So it was when one day Jupiter decided that he would get married, he invited all the animals to the wedding feast. All the animals were delighted to accept the invitation, they all loved a party, and Jupiter was always a very generous and genial host. All the animals that is, except the tortoise. He was feeling a bit grumpy and decided to stay at home. "I don't care much for parties anyway, he told his neighbour. I never enjoy myself and I don't go for all that dancing and singing."
The wedding was a great success, and everybody had a great time. Of course, it didn't escape Jupiter's attention that tortoise had not turned up. So the next time the great god came upon tortoise, he stopped and asked him why he had not come to join in the wedding celebrations. "Dear Jupiter, said Tortoise, I really don't like parties. I much rather stay home. There's no place like home, after all."
Now Jupiter was really annoyed with Tortoise. "If you like your home so much, he thundered, I decree that from now on you shall forever carry yours on your back!" And so it is that ever since that day, tortoises have to carry their home on their backs, wherever they go!

Once upon a time, in a small village in a land not that far away, there lived a very sweet little girl, with her mother and father. Her grandmother lived about half an hour's walk away, outside the village, in a clearing in the forest that covered the whole area. The grandmother as especially fond of the little girl, and she had made her a cute little red hat, out of velvet. The girl loved that hat so much that she wore it all hours of the day and night, and so people had started calling her Little Red Cap.
The grandmother was getting very old, and she had become bedridden and infirm. One day Little Re Cap's mother called her over, and gave her a parcel to take to her grandmother. There is some meat here, and a bottle of wine, which will no doubt cheer her up no end. Now be nice and polite when you get there, say, Good morning, Grandmother when you come in, and don't go snooping about the place, upsetting her. Go straight there, and don't linger on the path through the forest, make sure you don't run and skip, and don't drop the bottle. Have you got all that?" Little Red Cap assured her mother that she understood perfectly, and would do everything just as mother told her to.
So off she went, down the village lane, toward the track through the wood leading to her grandmother's house. After she had gone some distance, she heard a rustling in the undergrowth and there appeared before her the wolf. Now this wolf was not a very nice creature, but Little Red Cap, being young and naïve, always assumed everybody she met was just as nice, sweet and honest as she was, so she stopped and greeted the wolf in her usual friendly way.
"Good morning, Wolf", she said.
"Good morning, replied the wolf. You are looking very dainty today. Where would you be going so early in the morning?"
"I'm on my way to see my grandmother, replied Little Red Cap.
"your grandmother indeed, said the wolf. And what is that you are carrying I that little basket? Some nice presents for your grannie, I guess?"
That's right, said Little Red Cap. My mother roasted some nice beef yesterday, so that my grandmother might have something nourishing, and I have some wine to lift her spirits. She has not been very well, recently, she added.
And where does this grandmother of yours live? Asked wolf.
Little Red cap gave a detailed description of where grandmother's house was, down the track a while longer, near some oak trees, and behind some bushes, with a brightly painted front door. A little crooked chimney and a thatched straw roof. "you can't miss it!"
Now you may not know this, because in the times that we live we don't really encounter many wolves when we go for walks, but in those days, wolves were notorious for their ginormous appetites, and they were as likely to gobble up a few chickens as a small human being. So this wolf was eying up Little Red Cap, and thinking about her grannie at the same time, working out the best way to make sure he could have them both. He sauntered along the path a little, keeping up with Little Red Cap, and then he spoke again; "You see how beautiful this place is, with all the beautiful wild flowers growing amongst the tree trunks and the bushes. Why don't you have a little look around, and pick some of the flowers for your grannie, then she will not only have something nice to eat and drink, but she will have something nice to look at as well!" Little Red Cap forgot all her mother had told her about not lingering on the path, and she walked into the woods, amongst the trees, and started picking some of the delightful wild flowers that grew there in such abundance.
Our friend wolf, in the meantime had rushed as fast as he could to grannie's cottage which he found without any difficulty at all. He knocked on the door, and heard grannie's weak voice call out: "Who's there?"
"it is I, Little Red Cap, I've brought you some meat and wine from my mother. Please open the door for me, grannie", replied Wolf, making his voice sound as high pitched as he could to deceive the poor grandmother. "Just push up the latch, called grannie, I'm so weak I just can't get out of my bed!"
So the wolf lifted the latch, threw open the door, and rushed to the bedroom, where he jumped on the bed, and without any further ado, gobbled up the poor grandmother. He then put her cap on his head, and got into her bed, covering himself as much as he could with the bedsheets. There he waited.
He did not have to wait all that long before Little Red Cap appeared outside the cottage. She had collected a nice little bunch of wild flowers and was looking forward to see her grannie's eyes light up. She was a little surprised to see the front door wide open, she thought that perhaps grandmother had felt a bit better and had been up and about. She stepped into the room, and she thought there was a slightly odd smell about, but she shook off this feeling and called out to her grannie: "Good morning, grannie! Where are you?"
She heard some grumbling coming from the bedroom, so she walked inside there. It was quite dark in the room, as the curtains were still drawn, so she walked across, and opened the curtains and a window, to let in some fresh air. Then she turned toward the bed, where she saw what she thought was her grandmother lying down, her covers almost covering her whole face. She could see her ears and her eyes, both looked much larger than she remembered.
"Oh grandmother, said Little Red Cap, what great ears you have!"
That's so I can hear you better, answered wolf.
"And what great eyes you have, grannie!"
"That's so I can see you properly!" answered wolf, keeping his mouth covered.
"And what great hands you have, grannie!" exclaimed Little Red Cap.
"That's so I can lift you up!" said wolf.
"But grannie, what great teeth you have!"
"That's the better to eat you with", shouted wolf, and he immediately threw aside the bed covers, and jumped out of bed to gobble up poor Little Red Cap.
Having now feasted on both the grannie and her little gran daughter, wolf felt particularly satisfied, and he decided he might as well enjoy the home comforts of grannie's cottage a little longer, and spread himself on the bed. Before long he was fast asleep, emitting very loud snoring noises. Just then, a huntsman passed by the cottage, and he heard the strange noise coming from the bedroom window. His curiosity awakened, he decided to check out the source of this noise, and looked into the window. He immediately recognised the wolf he'd been hunting now for a number of weeks, and cocking his rifle, he stepped into the cottage and made his way to the bedroom. Taking careful aim, he shot the wolf dead.

There once lived an old widow, who had a daughter and a step daughter. Her step daughter was beautiful and hardworking, ever willing to do whatever was asked of her, little and large tasks, and she was always kind to everybody, including her mother and step sister. The step sister now, was rather plain looking, she was lazy and deceitful, and was always complaining to her mother about how her steps sister did not work hard enough, burned her toast and did not wash her dresses properly. The step daughter was made to sleep on a rough bed in the washing room, and for food she was only given left overs and dry bread crusts.
The poor step daughter was made to work on a spinning wheel put outside, next to a well. She worked so her, and spun so fast, that her fingers started to bleed. The spindle on the wheel became covered in blood, and the girl bent over the well to wash it off, otherwise she was afraid the blood might discolour the yarn she was spinning. But she dropped the spindle and it fell into the water. She did not want to be scolded for losing the spindle, so without thinking about the consequences, she hitched her skirt, and jumped into the water in order to retrieve it. But she could not feel the ground at the bottom, she kept sinking deeper and deeper, until eventually she lost consciousness. When she woke, she found herself in a charming meadow, covered I the greenest grass and a multitude of colourful flowers, all under a friendly sun spreading its warmth.
She got up and as she was naturally quite curious, she decided to take a walk and get to know her new surroundings. Before long she arrived at a bakery, with an oven full of bread. The bread was crying out; "Draw me out! Draw me out! We have baked long enough. If you don't draw us out we shall surely burn and be of no use to anybody!" So the girl looked around, and found the bread peel, a long stick with a broad flat end, which she had seen bakers use to pull bread out of the oven. She started working, slowly at first, because she was not used to this kind of work, but eventually she got the hang of it and before long she had emptied the oven, and all the bread had been placed on racks, cooling off. The work had made her hungry, and when one of the loaves invited her to have a taste, she did not hesitate. She took one of the loaves, and munching it, continued on her walk.
Before long she came across an apple tree, whose branches were almost touching the ground, so heavily laden were they with fruit. The apples cried out: "Shake the tree, shake the tree! We are all ripe, and we need to come off our tree, otherwise we will all rot away. Shake the tree!" So the girl, conscientious as ever, started shaking the tree with all her might. She shook for as long as it took for all the apples to fall down, then she proceeded to collect them all and put them neatly in a big heap. "Well done!" the apples shouted. "Take one of us to munch on, you'll find we taste pretty good!" So he girl took an apple from the top of the pile and polished it on her frock before biting into the juicy fruit. On she went on her walk.
Before long she came to a clearing where there stood a small cottage, and in front of the cottage stood an old woman. The old woman was frankly quite a sight, she was as ugly as any creature from eh land of ghouls, her teeth were too long, and grew over her lips, her nose was covered in grey hairs, and her bosoms hung down like flour sacks. Our young girl was somewhat taken aback by this apparition, and her impulse was to turn round and get out of there. Anything was better than this old hag! But just then the old woman cried out a greeting, and her voice was much friendlier than her appearance. "What are you afraid of, little girl? Don't run away, no harm will come to you here. Come and have a chat."
So the girl and the ugly old woman sat down together on a bench in front of the cottage. The old woman asked her how she came to her cottage, and where she was heading. The girl explained what had happened to her, from jumping into the well to find her spindle, waking up in the meadow, and meeting the bread loaves and the ripe apples. "I really don't know where I'm going, she said. I hadn't really given it much thought."
"Well then, said the old lady. Why don't you stop here for a while, you can help me tidy up my place, you seem to have a talent for that. If you can do that, all will go well with you, I will see to that."
"What would I have to do?" asked the girl.
The woman smiled a crooked smile. "I am Old Mother Frost" she said. The main job is to shake my bed thoroughly, so that all the feathers fly out. They will float down to the world, and turn into snow." The girl quite lied the sound of that, the old lady seemed very kind, in spite of her rather rough appearance, and she had certainly enjoyed the taste of the bread and the apples. So she readily agreed to stay for a while. She worked hard, as that was her nature, and always shook the bed with the utmost vigour, so that there was so much snow on earth that life came to a standstill. Old Mother Frost looked after her very well, fed her fresh fruit and roast meat every day, and she was able to sleep on a wonderful soft mattress. And she never had to do any spinning! Her life was very happy and there were never any angry words between her and Old Mother Frost.
But in spite of her wonderful life here, she eventually started feeling sad, and after a while she realised she was homesick. So she sat down with Old Mother Frost one day, and told her that she wanted to go back to see her step mother and sister." If I find it does not go so well down there, maybe I can come back here2, she said. Old Mother Frost agreed. "I can tell that you've been a little homesick these last few days, she said. It shows in your face, my dear girl. Of course you can go back, and I will keep an eye on you from here, when I see that you are suffering, I will come to fetch you myself, for I have grown very fond of you indeed."
So the next day, Old Mother Frost took her hand, and led her down a path which led to a great wooden gate, which she unlocked. The old lady give her the spindle, which she had lost in the well. "You must take this back, she said, and ten she gave her a large bag, filled with gold. "And this, she added, you have deserved this through your hard work." She then guided her through the gate, and when the girl had passed through it locked it again. When the girl looked around, to her surprise she found herself on a path leading to her step mother's house. She followed the path, and a little later was greeted by the cockerel, the chickens and the cat, who had all sorely missed her. She went in to see her mother, and because she had a bag full of gold, she was very warmly received.
The girl told the story of everything that had happened to her, and how Old Mother Frost had rewarded her with the bag of gold. When the step mother heard this story, she told her daughter that she too should try her luck, and travel to the meadow where Old Mother Frost dwelt, so she too would get a bag full of gold. The lazy daughter was not all that keen, as is all sounded like a lot of hard work to her, but her mother's greed was too strong, and this time she did not take no for an answer, and made her daughter sit down by the side of the well, drop the spindle in it and jump after it. And so it happened that the lazy daughter sank deeper and deeper, until eventually she lost consciousness.
When she woke, she found herself in a charming meadow, covered I the greenest grass and a multitude of colourful flowers, all under a friendly sun spreading its warmth.
She got up and as she tried to remember what her step sister had told her, she started to walk. Before long she arrived at a bakery, with an oven full of bread. The bread was crying out; "Draw me out! Draw me out! We have baked long enough. If you don't draw us out we shall surely burn and be of no use to anybody!" But the lazy daughter was not interested in dirtying herself rescuing the bread. "It's nothing to do with me, she said, I did not put you in the oven! Get yourselves out if you're so hot!" With this, she continued on her walk.
Before long she came across an apple tree, whose branches were almost touching the ground, so heavily laden were they with fruit. The apples cried out: "Shake the tree, shake the tree! We are all ripe, and we need to come off our tree, otherwise we will all rot away. Shake the tree!" But the lazy daughter just shook her head. "I'm not going to exhaust myself for a bunch of sour apples, she said, Shake yourself down if you're so clever!"
On she went on her walk.
Before long she came to a clearing where there stood a small cottage, and in front of the cottage stood an old woman. As her step sister had explained, the old woman was frankly quite a sight, she was as ugly as any creature from the land of ghouls, her teeth were too long, and grew over her lips, her nose was covered in grey hairs, and her bosoms hung down like flour sacks. But the lazy daughter was not afraid, having been warned. "So you must be Old Mother Frost" she said. Old Mother Frost confirmed that she was indeed her, and asked this new girl why she had come this way and where she was going. "I've come to give you a hand with some of your work", the lazy daughter told her. "That's very good, said Old Mother Frost, I can do with some help. My old bones are not getting any younger." So the lazy daughter started working for Old Mother Frost. Well, she worked quite well on the first day, but by evening she was so tired, she had hardly enough energy left to eat the wonderful food that had been prepare. So the next day she slowed down a bit, and only shook the bed in a perfunctory manner, so that only a few of the feathers flew out. Not much snow fell on the earth that day.
The next day she did even less, but Old Mother Frost did not complain. But the next day, the lazy daughter stayed in her bed until midday, and when she got up complained that there was no breakfast waiting for her. That was it for Old Mother Frost. "I've had enough of you, she said. I'm giving you the sack! You'll have to go back to where you came from!"
The lazy daughter was of course very happy to hear these words, because she thought she would now get her sack full of gold! Old Mother Frost took her by the arm, and led her to the great wooden gate, which she duly unlocked. Just step through here, she said, and you will return to your mother's village. Just as the lazy daughter, stepping through the gate, thought she was going to be handed her gold, Old Mother Frost picked up a bucket standing by the side of the gate, and poured the content all over the wretched girl. It was pitch black tar, which covered her all over. When the lazy daughter got home, however much she and her mother tried to wash it off, they could not remove it and the tar stuck to her for the rest of her life.

Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a cobbler and his wife. They desperately wanted to have children, but however they tried, it was all in vain. These people lived in a little house next to a mansion, and one of their bedroom windows looked out over the wall of the adjoining property, into an enormous garden, where flowers and vegetables grew side by side in abundance. But nobody ever visited the garden, it was rumoured that the owner of the house, an old woman, was in fact a terrible witch, who possessed terrible dark powers, and as a consequence everybody in the little town avoided contact with her.
But one fine morning, the cobbler's wife was sitting at her window looking out over the garden, when she spotted a little bed full of wonderful radishes. The sight of these radishes filled her with a great desire to have some, and however much she tried during the course of the day to forget about it, the desire to eat these radishes would not go away. Days and days passed, and her inability to satisfy her desire made her quite ill, she could hardly eat anything if she could not have the radishes. One evening her husband remarked that she looked quite unwell, and wanted to know what it was that was ailing her. "Oh, it's nothing, she said, I'm just feeling a little faint. It will pass,"
More days passed, and the cobbler watched his wife getting more and more ill. So he asked her again: "My dear wife, you must be honest with me, tell me what the matter is."
She then confessed to her husband that she had developed an insatiable appetite for the radishes growing on the other side of the wall in the witches' garden. The cobbler loved his wife very much, so he decided to set aside his worries about the witch, and made up his mind to get her some of those radishes, come what may. He waited till nightfall, then got out his ladder, and climbed over the wall. He rushed to the radishes bed as fast as his feet would carry him, and stuffed a few handfuls in his pockets, then scrambled back over the wall, into his own backyard. His heart was beating ferociously when he came back into the kitchen with his prize, and his wife cried with joy. She immediately set about preparing a salad with the fresh produce, and that night enjoyed the best sleep of her life.
For a few days, she was very happy, but bye and bye the desire returned, and she pleaded with her husband to go back into the neighbour's garden and get some more radishes. The husband consented, he loved his wife so much he would do anything for her. So that night he got his ladder out, climbed over the wall, and rushed, as fast as his feet could carry him towards the radishes bed. There he started pulling out the plants and stuffing them in his pocket, when suddenly he heard a screeching voice next to his ear: "A little birdie told me there was a thief in my garden, stealing my vegetables! Here I have caught you in the act, red handed as they say. Empty your pockets! You will pay very dearly for this, you wretched little man!"
The cobbler's knees were shaking, and as he deposited the radish bunches on the ground, he knew there would be a terrible price to pay, but he decided he would appeal to the witch's sense of human decency. "Dear lady, he said, I confess I have done you a terrible wrong, trespassing on your property and stealing your vegetables, but my wife is very ill indeed, and the only thing that keeps her going is the taste of your radishes. If she can't eat some of these she will surely die!" At this the witch laughed heartily. "Hahaha, hehehe, you wretched little creatures with your petty little desires. Tell me, have you any children?"
"No, the cobbler replied, We have tried for a long time to start a family but we are still without child". The with smiled, if you can call the grimace that appeared on her face a smile. "I will help you, she said, but you must give me something!"
The cobbler was happy to promise her anything to get out of that garden alive. "You can come and get all the radishes your little wife can eat, the witch continued, but when your wife gives birth to her child, as she will, you must give the child to me! I promise you I will take very good care of her indeed!" The cobbler fell on his knees, and bowed his head, "Thank, you, thank you", he muttered. The witch picked up the radishes from the ground, spat on them and stroked them, mumbling some incomprehensible words. "Take these, she said, and make sure your wife eats all of them tonight, don't waste any of them. And don't forget, if you try to cheat me, or get out of your promise, you will pay with your life". She turned about and walked away, leaving the poor cobbler on his own with his radishes. He climbed back over the wall, and into his kitchen, where his wife was waiting. He did not tell her what had happened between him and the witch, but set about helping his wife prepare the salad, and then making sure she consumed all of it.
As the witch had predicted, the wife fell pregnant, and gave birth to a cute little daughter. That very same evening the witch appeared at the kitchen door and demanded to see the newborn baby. She was obviously very pleased with what she saw, laughing heartily. "Hello there, my little Rapunzel she sang in her crooked voice. You're all mine! All mine!" And she disappeared carrying the little girl with her, leaving the cobbler to explain to his wife how they had come to loose their baby. It is said that the wife was so sad at the thought of the witch having taken her baby that she refused to eat anything at all after that and cried continuously, and eventually she passed away. Nobody remembers what happened to the unfortunate cobbler.
The witch, in the meantime, did indeed take very good care of the baby girl, whom she'd named Rapunzel, but the child was never allowed to leave the witch's house, and never had her hair cut, so that it grew and grew. When she was twelve years old, or thereabouts, the witch took her to an old tower, in the middle of nowhere, where she was locked in a room on the top floor. All around the base of the tower there grew large thorny bushes, so that nobody could get near to it. And to make doubly sure that her most treasured possession would not be disturbed, the witch put a magic spell on the entrance door to the tower, making it disappear.
The witch would visit Rapunzel every day, and in order to get into the room, at the top of the tower, she would call out to Rapunzel to let down her hair, which had grown so long, that it easily reached the ground. As the hair fell down to the ground, the witch used it to hold onto while she clambered up the wall, and through the window, into the room.
Years and years passed, and Rapunzel stayed locked up in the tower, while the witch brought her food every day. Now it so happened that one fine day, a knight rode by the tower on his horse, and he heard a sweet singing voice coming from the direction of the tower, but try as he might, he could not discover the singer. He rode around the tower, looking for an entrance, but there was none. So eventually he rode on, scratching his head. But so entranced was he by the melodious voice, that he could not help himself but to return to this mysterious place. So one day, as he was sitting on his horse, listening to the enticing tones coming from the tower, he heard another voice, calling out: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair!"
The astonished knight then saw Rapunzel appear in the window, and threw her long hair down to the ground. A few seconds later, he saw the witch climbing up the Wall, and entering through the window. He determined to wait in a place where he would not be seen, and waited and waited, until some time later, the hair was once more thrown over the window ledge, and he witnessed the witch descending, then disappearing on the road by the forest, towards the town. He did not wait much longer, but then he rode up towards the tower, and stood where the witch had stood, he called out, softly, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, please let down your hair!" He did not have to wait very long, before he saw the beautiful blond hair come falling down, and without wasting any more time, he climbed up against the wall as quickly as he could, using the hair as a climbing rope.
Rapunzel was shocked when, instead of the witch she was expecting, she saw the knight standing there in front of her. She hid her face behind her hands, and crept into the corner of the room. "Don't be afraid", said the knight. "I don't mean you any harm. I was attracted by your wonderful singing voice, and could not resist trying to find out who owns such a beautiful melodious voice!" His gentle voice and manner calmed Rapunzel, and she came out of her corner to have a look at this man. Now you should remember that Rapunzel had never before in her young life been in the company of any person other than the witch, although from some of the stories the witch had told her that other people existed somewhere in the world. Rapunzel had lots of questions to ask the knight, and he calmly explained all that she wanted to know about the world outside the tower. It began to get dark, and they decided that the Knight should go home, and return the next day, and visit her again after the witch had left. These daily visits went on for some time, and the knight realised he was falling in love with Rapunzel, so one day he asked her if she would have him for her husband. Rapunzel was delighted to accept his offer, for she too, had fallen in love with the knight, and she would much rather spend her life with him than with the wicked witch. They made a plan that on every visit, the knight would bring some silk yarn, which Rapunzel would weave into a ladder, which she would use to get out of the tower, as she obviously would not be able to use her own hair to climb down.
But the old witch was becoming suspicious. She had noticed a change in the girl's demeanour, she seemed to be a lot happier, smiling all the time, laughing and singing out loud. One day she asked Rapunzel what made her so happy, and the girl, who could not lie, told the witch that she was in love and about to get married to a brave knight. When she heard this the witch was furious, and in her fury started beating the girl about the head. Then, taking out some big scissors, she cut off the girl's hair, and stuffed it under her skirt. "You have spoiled everything, she told Rapunzel. I only wanted to have you all for myself, and I can't share you with anybody else, least of all some stupid knight who just wants to turn you into a housewife! Now I have to punish you, and later I shall think of a suitable punishment for your friend." The witch took Rapunzel by the hand, and uttering some magic formulas, the flew out of the tower, across the forest and landed in a desolate stretch of land. "I will leave you here in this wilderness to fend for yourself, said the witch. Before long you will be wishing that you had never met this wretched knight and his sweet talk, because you will surely perish here." And the witch flew off again, leaving Rapunzel all by herself.
The witch flew back to the tower, because she knew that the knight would turn up before long. And indeed, she had only just returned, when she heard his voice calling from below the window: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair!" The witch pulled out Rapunzel's hair from under her skirt, and tied one end to the window, then threw it out towards the ground. After a few seconds she could hear the knight's huffing and puffing as he negotiated the wall, and then he appeared in the window. She was hiding in a dark corner, and it took a few moments for the knight's eyes to find her in the shadows. "Rapunzel, he called out, it is I, why are you hiding in the corner?". Then the witch approached him, screeching and swearing at him: "You rascal! You would take advantage of a poor little creature and carry her away from me. But she has flown! A cat came and took her away, and now this cat is so wild and angry that she is going to scratch out your eyes!" With these words, the mad witch attacked the knight, scratching at his face with her long sharp nails. He bent away and swayed, and managed to parry some of her blows, but he knew he would have to get away, so he took his chance, and jumped out of the window. But the poor guy landed on the thorn bushes, and the thorns penetrated his hands, his face, and his eyes, and when he got up and scrambled away from the tower, he realised he could not see anything.
The blind knight was left wandering around the forest aimlessly, feeding himself on whatever he could find, fruits and berries he found on bushes, and roots that he managed to dig up. Forever he lamented the loss of his wife, and only the desperate hope that he might one day meet up with her again kept him going. He roamed and roamed, and year went by, until one day he came upon a little fence, with a gate in it. He heard some voices, and his heart jumped, because he was sure he recognised that wonderful melodious voice! He walked in the direction of the voice, calling out: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel". And it was indeed Rapunzel who dwelt in that little cottage, with her twins, who had been born shortly after the witch had left her for dead in the wilderness. She looked at the figure approaching her on the path, and although his hair was unkempt and long, and his beard had grown long and scraggy, she recognised him immediately and rushed into his arms. She cried and cried with joy, and her tears fell on his eyes, which miraculously cured them, and he was able to see again! They spent the rest of their lives together, and never again allowed anything to separate them. I have tried to find out what became of the witch, but nobody ever saw or heard of her again.

There was once a kingdom far to the east where all the citizens were very wealthy. The whole land was covered in fields of wheat, which grew abundantly and apparently effortlessly. The harvests were so rich that everybody had far more wheat than they could eat, which meant that they were able to sell it in the market to merchants from neighbouring kingdoms. This way, some of this kingdom's citizens were just as wealthy as the king.
Which did not please the king very much. Of course he was happy that his citizens never lacked any material things, and that their bellies were always full, because that way they never questioned his authority. But he was jealous and greedy. He had been looking at the straw, as it was brought from the fields, and the colour of the straw reminded him very much of the colour of gold. So he began to think of ways to turn the straw into gold, and this became an obsession. He bought all the straw that he could get hold of, and stored it in three large rooms in his palace. He employed alchemists from his own kingdom and beyond to come up with a formula to turn the straw into gold, but nobody was ever to accomplish this.
The king's obsession was fairly well known throughout his kingdom, and one day a miller, who had a very beautiful daughter, thought he could take advantage of this. Like most fathers, he thought his daughter was the most beautiful young girl in the land, and he wanted nothing more than that she should marry the king, and become queen. One day, he gathered up his courage, and took himself to the king's palace, and asked for an audience. He told the king about his daughter, claiming that she could spin straw into gold. The king was intrigued, "Well, my good man, he said to the miller, if your daughter can indeed do this, then I should be very happy to make her my queen. We will put her to the test. Bring her back to the palace tonight."
Immediately, the king had a spinning wheel installed in the first room where he stored the straw. When the miller's daughter arrived later that day, the king took her into the room, and showed her the wheel and the straw. "I want all this straw spun into gold, the king told her. I will come back early tomorrow morning, and if it is not done, I will have you put to death. So don't delay, and get started!" With this, he left the room, and locked the door behind him.
But of course the poor girl had no idea how to turn straw into gold, she was not even very good at using a spinning wheel. She started to cry, and the more she thought about the impossible task she had been given, the more she cried. Then, suddenly, the door opened, and a curious looking little man appeared. His head was far too big for his body, and his arms were long and thin, whereas his legs were short and stumpy! "my dear girl, he said, why are you crying and weeping like this? What can the matter be? A pretty girl like you should not be so sad!" The poor girl explained to him what she had been asked to do. "all this straw had to be spun into gold, she cried, I don't have a clue how to go about that, I can't even use a spinning wheel. But if I don't do this job, the king will have me put to death tomorrow!" The funny little man's eyes lighted up. "Is that all!" he shouted. "What will you give me, if I do the job for you?" The girl was wearing beautiful necklace, with a silver medallion. "You can have my necklace!" she said. "Excellent, said the little man. He took the necklace, put it in his pocket, and set himself at the wheel, and started spinning. By the time the girl had stopped crying, he had spun the first bobbin, and it did indeed look like pure gold. Humming to himself, as he went along, the little dwarf kept at his task without a pause or a break, and before long, all the straw in the room had been spun, and there on the table lay some twenty bobbins of pure gold thread.
At the first ray of the sun came through the window, so the king opened the door, and he was very   pleased when he saw the gold sitting there. "You're a good girl, he said, you really can spin straw into gold!" He called one of his servant maids, and told her to feed his guest, and then let her sleep. "We'll carry on tonight, he said, beaming. The sight of this gold had only increased the king's greed, and his mouth watered at the prospect of turning the rest of his straw store into gold as well.
So that evening, after a long rest, the king took the girl into the second room filled with straw. This room was even bigger than the first one, and the girl's heart sank. "get to work!" the king commanded her. "I expect all this straw to be spun into gold by the time I come back tomorrow morning, otherwise I will certainly have you put to death!" He left the room, and locked it behind him, leaving the poor girl to contemplate her fate. She looked at all the straw in fro of her, and the mere sight of it brought her tears out again. But lo and behold, at the first tear to come out of her pretty eye, there was the little dwarf again. "Hello, my dear, I see you may need a little more help," he said. The girl, sobbing explained to him what was expected of her. "I can do it, said the dwarf. But what will you pay me this time?" The girl had a gold ring on her finger, with a pretty green stone, which her mother had given her on her deathbed. "All I've got is this ring", she said. "That will do", said the dwarf, and he took the ring off her finger, pocketed it and sat himself down again at the spinning wheel. The wheel went whhirr whhirr whhirr, and the dwarf hummed, rhhhumm, rhhhumm rhhhummm, the bobbins went whizzz whizz whizz and clickacklicka click as the landed on the table, and the night went faster than any shooting star in the sky. When he had finished, the dwarf courtsied before the girl, then disappeared as fast he had had come.
The king was very happy with the progress, and again ordered his servant maid to look after the girl, so that she would be well rested before resuming her task on the third and last room full of straw. He had reasoned that he should marry this girl, her skill was rather unique, and he would not want her to do the same work for any other man in his kingdom. So it was that evening, when the king took her into that third room. This room was as large as the other two combined, and the sight of it filled the girl with dread. "I want you to spin all this straw into gold before the break of dawn, the king told her, but if you can accomplish this, then you will be my bride!"
As soon as the king had left her alone in the room, and locked the door, she began to cry again. And as soon as the first tear drop rolled down her cheek, the little dwarf appeared again, as if by magic.
"look at all this straw, the girl cried, The king wants all this spun into gold by morning!" And she burst into another tearful bout of crying. !"I can do it for you, all right, the dwarf said, but what will you give me this time?" "alas, I have nothing left to give you", the poor girl said. The dwarf smiled, slyly. "So the king has promised to marry you, has he not? Well, if he does, and you have your first child, you will give that to me!" The girl thought about this for a moment. She did not much like the idea of giving away her first child, but then again, that might never happen. Who knows what the future holds. She did know that all this straw in this enormous room had to be spun, or she would certainly die. "Very well, she said to the dwarf, if I become Queen, you will have my first born!" At this, the dwarf took his place behind the spinning wheel, started feeding in the straw, and with a whhirr whhirr whhirr the wheel spun faster and faster, and with a rhhhumm, rhhhumm rhhhummm the dwarf hummed in a low tone, and with a clickacklicka click the bobbins landed on the table, until they overflowed, so much straw was there in this room. But it seemed to the girl that the more straw there was to be spun, the quicker the dwarf's arms and legs moved, and before long all the straw had been spun, and there on the table was a hoard of gold as nobody had ever imagined.
The dwarf made his goodbye, and disappeared again. The girl sat down on the floor and contemplated her fate. Then the king entered the room, and was overjoyed. Now he was by far the richest man in his kingdom, and he was going to marry the woman who could turn straw into gold!
There was a big wedding, attended by all the citizens in the kingdom, and for a while the girl lived a happy life. She had forgotten all about the dwarf and the promise she had made, and after a year or so, the Queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter. A few days after the birth, as she was resting with her baby daughter, suddenly, there appeared in her bedroom the little dwarf. "I have come to collect that what you promised me, he said, menacingly. The Queen was desperate. "I cannot give you my child, she cried! Take anything you want, I will give you all the riches I have, but leave me my baby!"
The dwarf was adamant. "I can get everything I desire, he said, but I can't take a baby. To have a small human is more important to me than all the gold in the whole world." However much the queen tried to reason with him, he would not change his mind. "I will give you three days, he said at length. Then I will come back, and you have to give me your daughter, unless you can discover my name. If you can tell me my name when I come back, you will be able to keep our daughter."
The queen had no choice but to agree to this. She called together all the clerks in the castle and had them make up lists of names, all the names in the kingdom and all the names in foreign lands. The next morning, the dwarf returned, and asked: "do you know my name, my queen?" The queen started reading from her list, "Alexander, Antoine, Balthasar, Sebastian, Pericles, Melchior, Gerard..". On and on she read, for several hours, but the dwarf just stood there, smiling and shaking his head, muttering, "No, that's not my name, no, that's not my name, no, that's not my name" The queen sent out messengers all over the kingdom to find more names, unusual ones, forgotten ones, forbidden ones.
The next day the dwarf returned. "Do you know my name, my queen?" So the queen started on the list of unusual names that had been collected, "Whistleblower, gobsmacker, elephant tooth, whalebone, dumpling, bedwetter, creepcrawly..and on and on and on. But the dwarf just stood there, smiling and shaking his head, muttering, "No, that's not my name, no, that's not my name, no, that's not my name, no no no".
Now the queen was very desperate and she could not sleep all night. But then, on the morning of the third day, one of the clerks she had sent out came back to the palace, and rushed into her room. "My queen, he began, I have not found any names we have not heard before, but as I was wandering around the countryside I came upon a little glade, at the foot of a hill, near where the forest begins, and where one only finds animals and the odd stray traveller like myself. There, sheltered by some trees, I found a curious little house, with a fire burning outside it, and around the fire was this funny, odd looking little man, dancing on his short legs, and singing a little song which he kept repeating, over and over again." As you can imagine, the queen was getting a little impatient, and she urged the clerk to come to the point. "This is what he was singing, the clerk went on,
"Today I cook and bake and I potter,
tomorrow I will have the queen's daughter,
because nobody knows this thing,
that my name id Rumpelstiltskin!"
The queen jumped for joy when she heard this, and she was still smiling when the dwarf turned up for the third time. He made a little bow, and asked: "Do you know my name, my queen?" The queen looked at him with a very serious expression: "Is your name, Roustabout?" she asked.
The little dwarf shook his head, "No, that' not my name." So the queen said: "Your name then , is it perhaps, Romulus?"
The little dwarf shook his head, "No, that' not my name." So the queen said: "your name, then, is it perhaps, Rumpelstiltskin?" The dwarf almost fell over where he stood. This was impossible! "What witch told you this, he shrieked, I shall kill her! I shall kill her!" He started stamping his feet on the floor, and he stamped so vigorously that he broke the floorboards, and half his leg disappeared underneath. He got stuck so badly he could not pull it out again, he pulled and he pulled, so hard, that the rest of his body flew over, leaving half his leg stuck in the floorboard. His face turned beetroot red, and cursing the queen, the king, all the straw in the land, spinning wheels and wheel barrows, and all the witches in the whole world, he hopped away on his one leg. The queen held her baby daughter in her arms, and kissed her. We don't know whether they lived happily ever after, but they never had another visit from the odd little dwarf.

There was a time, long before the inhabitants of Britain wrote down their histories for us all to read, that country was inhabited not just by people like you and me, but wizards, ghouls, monsters, dragons, tricksters, and worse, demons. And just as the mythical gods in ancient Greece and Egypt had relations with humans, so did these ghouls and demons, and their offspring had strange magical powers that no other creatures on this earth possessed. It is rumoured that is how Merlin came about, his mother a poor noble woman and his father a diabolical ghoul. One dark, sleepless night a ghost came up to me and told me how a long, long time ago, when he still lived his life as a king in Britain, he made the acquaintance of Merlin the Wizard. This is his story.
My name is Uther Pendragon, and I was the third and youngest son of a great king, Constans. When I was still a young child, my father died, and as a result my life was in danger of death. This is how it came about. My oldest brother, and my father's heir, Constantius, had spent his youth and early manhood in a monastery. He showed scant interest in affairs of state, tournaments, battles and such knightly pursuits as a king's son is normally trained for. So by all accounts he was not a very good king when he succeeded my father. My father had fought many battles with invading Danes and Saxons, and had always successfully defended his realm, but these foreign invaders rejoiced greatly after his death, when they heard that Constantius the Monk, as people referred to him, had been crowned king. They calculated they would have more success against him. So it came to pass that they raised a great army and invaded Britain.
Now my father had always enjoyed the full support of a quite brilliant warrior and knight, by the name of Vortigern. When my brother Constantius called on him to help him raise an army to take up arms against the Danes, however, Vortigern sent a message to say he was too old and weak. All the battles he had fought for my father had taken their toll, and he was not half the man he used to be. Or so he claimed.
Constantius did what he could, and he did have the support of many of the barons and knights who had been loyal to my father, but the Danes were too crafty and strong, and they inflicted a heavy defeat on my brother's forces. Havoc and chaos ensued, the Danes went virtually unopposed in their campaign of rampage across the countryside, killing knights, farmers and peasant alike, taking their women and their worldly goods, and occupying their castles and their homes before destroying them and moving on to the next. So the good barons sent a delegation to Vortigern, as they knew full well that Constantius would never be strong enough to drive the Danes back into the sea.
This Vortigern was not just a good warrior, he was ambitious and crafty, unscrupulous, even. He said he would not lift a finger to fight the Danes on behalf of Constantius the Monk. However, he indicated that if a situation arose where Constantius was no longer in the picture, now that would be a different story.
When the barons received this message they were temporarily thrown into a quandary. But then some of them rode into my brother's castle and murdered him without further ado. My remaining brother, Aurelius and I were still but children, too young to succeed to the throne, so the barons offered the throne to Vortigern, and he, unsurprisingly, accepted the position and immediately set about organising an army to engage the Danes.
During this time some of my father's most loyal friends took my brother Aurelius and myself out of the country, and across to sea to Brittanny, or Little Britain as it was then commonly known, in a country which you now know as France. This was done in order to protect us, because these good barons knew Vortigern well, and reasoned that he might well mean to have us murdered so as to stop us laying claim to the throne at some point in the future.
Vortigern eventually succeeded in defeating the foreign invaders, and drove them out of the country. A great feast was organised to celebrate the success of the military campaign, and all the barons and knights who participated were invited to join King Vortigern, as he now was. At this great feast, the men who had killed my father came up to Vortigern, and demanded their just reward for this deed, which had resulted in Vortigern becoming King. But Vortigern reasoned that he could not really afford to reward the murderers, as this might encourage others to do the same thing to him. So he feigned to be indignant and horrified, denying that he, Vortigern, had anything at all to do with Constantius' death and immediately had the men seized and thrown in jail. The men were charged with regicide and condemned to death. But these barons had very influential friends, and before long an insurrection started against the king.
More and more knights joined in the fight against the king, and in the end, he had no choice but to send a delegation to Henkist, the leader of the Saxons, asking for assistance. Henkist agreed to this request, as he saw it as a way to finally get in foothold in England, and came over with an army of Saxons, which soon quelled all resistance.
All this left Vortigern very unhappy, and he did not feel very safe at all. On one side he feared the English barons who he thought were quite capable of creating problems for him, and on the other side he did not trust Henkist. To strengthen his bond with Henkist, he gave him his daughter in marriage, and to protect himself against his English barons, he decided to build an impregnable fortress.
A suitable site was found on the Salisbury plain, and one fine day workers started digging and laying foundations. But when they returned to the site the next morning, they discovered that all their work had been destroyed. Undaunted by this setback, they started again, with renewed vigour, and by the end of the second day, they had started on the outer wall. You can just imagine their surprise and horror, when the workers returned the next morning to find all their work destroyed once again. This time Vortigern decided that something must be wrong. He was well aware that he had obtained his crown by deception, and thought maybe he was being punished by forces beyond his control. So he sent for his astrologers, and ordered them to find out what caused the disruption to his work.
The astrologers went away to consult their charts and the heavenly constellations, and early the next morning returned to the court to report to the king. This is what they told the king: that some years earlier, a boy had been born in the kingdom, whose father was not from this earth. All that had to be done, was to find this boy, kill him, and scatter his remains over the building site. That would satisfy whatever demonic forces were at work, and the king would then be able to complete building his castle without any further disruptions.
Now this boy did indeed exist, and he was none other than Merlin. His mother had been a poor noble woman, and his father a demon who had come to earth to have a son, who, once grown up, could then help him carry out his evil designs on mankind. But the demon's plans had been thwarted because the mother had sought the protection of a good hermit, who had baptized the child and trained him to use his unearthly powers for the good of mankind. This turn of events was much to the chagrin of the boy's demon father, and he used the problems Vortigern had with his castle to send a message to his astrologers, which would result in the death of his useless son.
So it followed that Vortigern sent some of his most trusted men all over the land, looking for a lone mother with a child, but without a husband and eventually two of them came upon the hermit's abode. When Merlin saw them he immediately recognised that they were looking for him, so he stepped forward and introduced himself. He told the knights that he knew why they were looking for him, and explained to them that it was not necessary to kill him; just take me to King Vortigern, he said, and I will explain the mystery to him.
So the knights took Merlin back to the king's castle, and introduced him to the king. Vortigern immediately took Merlin to the building site, and showed him the havoc caused by the mysterious forces. After wondering about the site for a few minutes, Merlin spoke to the king: I can see what's going on here, he said. At the very place where your builders are trying to lay the foundations for your castle, just below the surface, are some large pools of water. At the bottom of these pools are some rather large stones, which act as covers for the hiding places of two enormous dragons, so large, are they, that nobody alive I the world has ever seen any like them! One of these is white as the purest milk ever to be milked from a cow, the other as the deepest red, like the blood shed by your knights on the battle field. These beasts sleep all day long, but as soon as the sun sets, they engage in a terrible struggle, which is ever without a result, for their powers are so evenly balanced, and they have not enough room to manoeuvre. So every night, when these terrible monsters start their furious battle, the walls that your builders put up during the day, are destroyed.
The king was fascinated by this explanation. What can we do about it? he asked.
It's very simple, said Merlin. Get your men to drain the water from the underground pools, and then have the stones pulled out. You will need some very strong ropes and a large number of horses, because they will be very heavy. But once that is done, the following night, the dragons will have more room, and they will be able to finish their fight, so that after that, you will not have any more trouble and you will be able to build your castle.
Vortigern gave the necessary orders to his workmen, and the immediately set about digging trenches towards a nearby stream, which would drain the water from the pools. When that was accomplished, they set about lifting he stones; this proved rather more troublesome, as they were indeed, as Merlin had predicted the largest stones any of them had ever seen. But after a long and arduous struggle, they managed to do so, and then the assembled workers, the king and all his knights, and Merlin could see there the two dragons lying side by side, sleeping. They were indeed the most horrendous vile looking creatures, of enormous size, one of them, the white one, had two heads , and as they slept, fire and smoke escaped from their nostrils. By now, the sun was setting, and the dragon started to stir. As Merlin had predicted, they immediately commenced a furious struggle, spitting fire at each other like striking lightning, one throwing the other in the air, then the other trying to strangle his opponent, all the time emitting the most fearful bellowing noises. The fight went on for what seemed like hours, and Vortigern and his men watched in fascination, not a little fearful themselves that either one of the terrible monsters might turn its attention to them. But eventually, as the first light of the new sun started to peer over the eastern horizon, the white dragon had got the better of his opponent, and was seen crushing it to death, The red creature fell down to earth with an enormous thud, making the ground shudder, and then miraculously seemed to turn to dust. The white dragon raised itself, and took off into the sky, away from the rising sun. It disappeared amongst the clouds, and since that morning not a single person on earth has ever laid eyes on it again.
King Vortigern was delighted with this outcome. As a reward for his services he offered Merlin the position of chief counseller to the King, which Merlin accepted. For some time all was well, the building of the king's castle now proceeded at pace, without any further incidents. There were some in the king's court, however, who were envious of Merlin's position. They thought it was not right that one so young should have the king's ear at all times, and often the king showed that he preferred Merlin's counsel over that of anybody else's. One day one of these envious knights put it to the king, that as Merlin was such a know-it-all, he should be able to tell the king the hidden meaning of the fight between the two dragons, after all, it was common knowledge in those days that everything had a hidden meaning. So the king, who himself was very curios, summoned merlin and bade him to explain the meaning of the struggle they had all witnessed. Merlin was reluctant to speak on this matter however, and the king got angry. He threatened to have Merlin killed if he did not provide him with the explanation he wanted. The reason Merlin was reluctant to speak of this matter was that he could see that the king was very nervous about his position, and still felt guilty about the actions he had taken to get the crown. But in the end he decided to speak. First, however, he thought he should advise the king that his threats did not mean anything.
My good king, he started, you should know that your threat to kill me is meaningless. You cannot kill me any more than you would have been able to discover the reason for your foundations crumbling by yourself. Because of the powers I inherited from my father, no mortal man can ever harm me. Only I myself can bring about y end in this world. You are curious to know the meaning of the two dragons struggle. I will tell you, but I will tell you now that you will not like it very much. The red one, whom you saw defeated represents yourself, king Vortigern. The white dragon, with its two heads, represents the two sons of King Constans, the princes Aurelius and Uther Pendragon. These two will return from Brittany, with a formidable army, and they will inflict defeat upon you and your ally, Henkist the Saxon. This impregnable castle of yours will be set alight, and will burn to the ground, and all inside it will perish just as the red dragon perished.
As you can imagine, King Vortigern was none too pleased with this prediction, and in spite of what Merlin had told him about him not being able to be hurt by any mortal man, he gave the order that any knight who came across Merlin should kill him forthwith. But Merlin had disappeared, and none could find him, wherever they searched.
And of course Merlin's prediction came about. As these events were unfolding in Salisbury, my brother Aurelius and I did indeed raise an army and we defeated Vortigern and Henkist, and claimed our rightful inheritance. What happened next is another story, which will take a long time to tell. Suffice it for me to say that Merlin came back to the court following Vortigern's demise, and proved a faithful servant to me and my family for a very long time. With this, Uther Pendragon's ghost disappeared into thin air, just like the white dragon had done in his fantastic tale.

A boy called Peter lived with his parents in a village on the hillside. His parents, like most of the other people in the village, were sheep farmers. Everybody in the village took turns to look after the sheep, and when Peter was 10 years old, he was considered old enough to take his turn at shepherding.
But Peter was too easily bored, and he found it very tiresome being on the hillside with only sheep for company. So he'd find ways to amuse himself, running up rocks, climbing trees, chasing sheep, but nothing really kept him amused for very long. Then he hit upon a brilliant idea. He climbed to the top of the tallest tree, and started shouting towards the village: "Wolf! Wolf! Wooolf! Woohoolf!"
One of the villagers heard him, and got all the other men together, and armed with axes, hoes and forks, they ran out of the village to chase away the wolf and save their herd. Of course when they got there, they merely found Peter perched high up in his tree, laughing, and the sheep grazing peacefully. They were very annoyed with him. That night Peter got a spanking from his mother and was sent to bed without any supper.
For a while life went on again as normal, and people forgot about the incident. Peter managed to behave himself whenever it was his turn to mind the sheep. Until one day, he got really bored again. He picked up some sticks, and running through where the sheep were grazing, he started hitting the sticks together, and shouting: "Wolf! Wolf! Wooolf! Woohoolf! Woohoohoooolf!"
Sure enough, somebody in the village heard and before long the men all come running up the hill armed with their sticks and axes and hoes and shovels, ready to chase away the big bad wolf, and save their sheep and the poor shepherd boy. Imagine their consternation when they arrived in the field to see their herd grazing peacefully, and Peter sitting on a big rock, laughing uncontrollably.
That night Peter got a good telling off, an even better spanking from his mother, and was again sent to bed without any supper. For a few days people in the village went around moaning about Peter and his tricks, but before long things settled down again, and life resumed its normal uneventful course, and Peter had to do his turn at shepherding again every now and then. He decided he should behave himself, he really didn't want to upset everybody all the time, and he especially didn't want another one of his mother's spankings!
Then, one afternoon when Peter was in the fields with the sheep, he noticed some of them were getting nervous, they started bleating and running hither and thither. Peter didn't know what was the cause of this strange behaviour, sheep were running all over and making an ever louder racket. He got worried and decided to climb a tree so he could see what was going on. He balanced on a sturdy branch and looked around, what he saw almost made him fall out of the tree. There was a great big hairy wolf, chasing the sheep, biting at their legs, snapping at their tails. For a few seconds Peter was speechless. Then he started shouting: "Woolf! Woolof! Woohoohooloof!"
In the village an old man heard the shouting. "Oh no, not that Peter again", he said, shaking his head. "What's going on?" enquired another villager. "It's that Peter again, he just can't help himself".
"That boy needs to be the centre of attention all the time", said another. "Wait till his mother gets a hold of him", added yet another. Nobody believed that this time there really was a wolf, and nobody got their hoe out, or their axe, or their shovel. All the sticks were left in the sheds and nobody rushed up the hillside. It wasn't until very much later that afternoon, that the boy sent to take over the shepherding from Peter found dead sheep's bodies strewn all over the hillside, and Peter still up there in his tree, whimpering, that the villagers found out there really had been a wolf this time.
At last Peter learnt his lesson, that if you always tell lies, people will eventually stop believing you; and then when you're telling the truth for a change, when you really need them to believe you, they won't.

A crow, wandering the streets, came upon a big old jug. She peeped inside and saw there was some water in it, but try as she might she could not get her head down into the jug far enough to reach the water. As the crow knew very well that water is scarce, she could not just give up on it, and she hit on a clever plan. Using her beak, she started picking up pebbles from the ground all around and dropping them into the jug. Each pebble that dropped into the jug made the water rise just a tiny bit, and bye and bye, the level rose high enough for her to quench her thirst.

A rich man wanted to give his wife a surprise for her birthday, so he went around town, inviting his friends and relatives to attend a sumptuous banquet in her honour at his house. His dog got wind of this and considered it would do no harm if he invited one of his friends to join him at the feast.
Dogs are always hungry and they're always on the look-out for a free meal, and this dog's friend was no different, so he had no qualms about accepting the invitation. He turned up early that evening, and observed the cooks hard at work preparing the various dishes. He really thought this was his lucky day and looked forward to stuffing himself so that he wouldn't feel hungry for two or three days at least. He got so excited that he raised his tail, and wagged it vigorously.
One of the cooks saw the wagging tail sticking up over the pots and pans, and became very annoyed at seeing a stray dog wondering around in the kitchen. He caught the dog by its wagging tail, and after swirling it around a couple of times, threw it with all his might out of the open window. The dog came down hard against a wall, and howled away. He was still limping when he met some of his friends down the road. "I thought you were going out to a great dinner party tonight, but you look rather worse for wear", said one of his friends, "whatever happened?"
The limping dog shook his head. "I had a fantastic time, I think", he said "The wine flowed freely all night long and I must have drunk rather more than is good for me. I can't for the life of me remember how I got out of there!"

A guard dog and a cock had been living on a farm for some considerable time, and had become good friends. One day they decided they would like to see the world and they set out together. As night fell, they found a nice tree where they decided to spend the night. The cock flew up into the branches and was soon fast asleep. The dog settled in the hollow trunk below.
At the first crack of dawn, the cock woke up, and crowed loudly. After all, it had been his job for years to wake up everybody on the farm, and one day on the road had not changed his habits. Just down the road a fox was resting, and hearing the cock crowing, thought this would make a good breakfast for him. So he stood under the tree, and called up to the cock. "What a lovely voice you've got, Mr Cock", the fox said. "Why don't you come down from your high perch so that we can get acquainted?"
The cock smiled. "I should love to get acquainted, Mr Fox", he said. "My servant is sleeping at the foot of the tree, do wake him, and ask him to let you in". The greedy fox could already taste the cock, and knocked on the tree trunk, waking the guard dog. The dog too, remembered his duties from his time at the farm, and seeing the fox, jumped on him and tore into him.

It was a fine summer's day and fox was out for a stroll when he spotted a crow sitting on a high branch of a tree. The fox couldn't help but notice that the crow had in his beak a very large chunk of cheese! The fox being a crafty fox, and the fact that he'd not yet had his breakfast, decide that this was too good an opportunity to miss, and sat down at the foot of the tree. He watched the crow as he thought to come up with a ruse which would deliver the cheese to him. The crow eyed him suspiciously, being very much aware of the fox's reputation. But she considered herself quite safe, as it is well known that foxes do not climb trees.
"My my", said the fox at last, looking up towards the crow, "What a magnificent noble bird I see before me! Your beauty is indeed without equal, mistress, and the effect of the sunlight on your feathers is surely beyond compare! I heard from my friends that it is your voice, however, that is your finest attribute, and I have been longing to hear you sing!"
Now the crow had never really given much thought to the quality of her voice, but she was mightily flattered by the fox's compliments. As a result she forgot all about her suspicions, and threw caution to the wind. She opened her mouth, and started singing a tune, as loudly as she could: "caw craw craw!" As soon as she did so, of course, down fell the cheese, and the fox put her paw over it. "Well, mistress, you do indeed have a fine voice", he called out to her, "if only your brain was quite as sharp!

All the hares in the great forest were called together for a meeting. Their elders had decided on the get together so that they could discuss their miserable fate. They just had too many enemies; men, dogs, beasts and birds of prey all hunted the hare for food, and they lacked the means to defend themselves. They had no great jaws full of sharp teeth, like some dogs or the wolf; they had no great claw with sharp nails, such as the bear; they didn't have spikes on their back, like the hedgehog, that would stop a predator. They were desperate and decided they could just not go on any longer being persecuted and hunted. The only way out, they resolved, was to go and commit mass suicide. Nearby was a deep pool, and the decided they would just all jump in there together and drown, putting an end to their misery once and for all.
A large colony of frogs lived in the pool, and some of them were basking in the sunshine on the bank, when there was a terrible racket of the hares rushing towards the pool. Startled, the frogs croaked in anguish, and jumped in the water, hiding themselves. One of the older and wiser hares, who was leading the charge towards the pool, saw this and stopped. He raised his paws in the air. "Friends", he shouted, "Stop! Let's reconsider. Things are not quite as bad as they seem, here are some creatures who are actually afraid of us, so we are not the lowest of the low after all!"

Two men were travelling together through a distant land. They made rather odd travelling companions, because one of them was incapable of ever telling the truth and could only tell lies, whereas the other could not tell a lie if his life depended on it, but could only ever say the truth as he saw it. They had been travelling for some time, when they came to the land of the monkeys. The king of the monkeys heard that two strangers had arrived in his realm, and he was very keen to impress them with his magnificence and power, so he ordered to have them brought before him.
He arranged to receive them seated on his throne in his state room, in the middle of his palace, and had a large retinue of courtiers and servants lined up in long rows, both inside the room and along all the passages on the way in. As they made their way towards the state room, the travellers were quite nervous, and they bowed when they came before the king.
The king welcomed them heartily, and then asked them if they'd ever been in the presence of a mightier king. The traveller who always lied spoke first. "Sire, I have travelled all over the world, and never before have I been so impressed by the splendour and might of your court!" The king seemed to be quite pleased to hear this, and he asked, "And what do you think of my subjects?"
"Sire," replied the lying traveller, "your subjects must be the most fortunate people I have ever come across in all my extensive travels, fortunate to be ruled by such a splendid and mighty monarch as you are!" The monkey king was delighted with this answer, he clapped his hands and called on his servants to prepare a magnificent feast for this guest, and to ensure that his every need was taken care of. Then he turned to the other traveller and asked him the same question.
This was of course the traveller who could only tell the truth as he saw it, and he said; "Sire, I think you are a fine ape, and all the subject you rule over are very fine apes too!" The king of the monkeys was enraged when he heard this, and he jumped from his throne. He ordered his guards to seize the luckless traveller and to beat him to death.

A very long time ago, in the county of Lincolnshire, England, there lived an old gentleman, Sir John of the Bounds, who had three sons, John, Otho and Gamelyn. Gamelyn was much younger than his two brothers, having been born when his father was already in advanced years, but he was the apple in his old father's eyes.
As the old man's health began to decline, he decided he should draw up his will. He did not care too much for his elder sons, and he was not sure that they would be fair to their young brother. For that reason he wanted to be sure that Gamelyn got his fair share, and he decreed that all his lands and possessions should be split equally between the three.
When old Sir John finally died, his oldest son did of course inherit his title, so he became the new Sir John. As Gamelyn was still a minor, the new Sir John became his legal guardian, in control of all his possessions and wealth. With the connections he had in the church and amongst his fellow knights, and his new riches, it was not very difficult for Sir John to effectively seize all of Gamelyn's possessions, and to use them to enrich himself.
One day Gamelyn questioned his brother about what had happened to his inheritance, which left Sir John very angry and determined to teach the young boy a lesson. However, like most bullies, Sir John was a physical coward, and he dare not engage Gamelyn himself. So he ordered some of his servants to give Gamelyn a beating. However, so strong had Gamelyn become, that he easily defeated all of them. When Sir John saw this he locked himself in his quarters until all had quietened down. The brothers then made their peace, and Sir John promised to restore Gamelyn's inheritance to him, and to treat him with more respect in the future.
During this time in history, there were many fairs held around the English counties, and one of the attractions were the wrestling competitions. One such competition was to be held nearby, with prizes being offered to the winner. Gamelyn decided he would try his luck at one of these. His brother, Sir John, was still being friendly towards him, so he was happy to lend Gamelyn a horse to go to the fair, secretly wishing his young brother would get a good beating. After Gamelyn left for the fair, Sir John had all the entrances to his castle locked, and gave instructions to all his servants not to let Gamelyn back in.
At the fair, a large number of hopeful men, some young and some not so young, had entered the wrestling contest hoping to defeat the reigning champion, who was a massive hulk of a man, standing almost seven feet tall. Gamelyn put his name down, and set down to watch the competition. The champion was obviously an experienced wrestler and had no real difficulty disposing of his many challengers. By and by it was Gamelyn's turn, and the champion thought he should not have too many problems disposing of one so young. However, he found the young man to be a slippery opponent, who managed to wrestle free form every grip the champion tried, and when eventually Gamelyn launched an attack of his own, he was able to lift the champion off the ground and throw him down with such force that the man was unable to rise up again.
Gamelyn now stood there as the victor, and waited for the next challenger, his appetite whetted. But nobody entered the ring. Having seen how easily he disposed of the champion, everybody decided they wanted to avoid a similar fate. Gamelyn was declared the new champion, and he happily received his prizes: a fully grown ram and a gold ring.
As he approached his home, followed by a band of admirers, his brother saw him coming and decided to keep the castle doors locked. However, Gamelyn easily broke down the door, and picking up the gate watchman who had refused him entry, threw him into the courtyard well. Gamelyn invited all his admirers and hangers on into the castle and arranged a great banquet for them, using supplies from Sir John's cellar.
After the feast was over, and all the guests had departed in very good spirits, Sir John finally made an entrance and rebuked his young brother for being too generous with his wines and ales. "Well, dear brother", said Gamelyn, "you've had the use of all my lands and possessions for many a year, so I think I've probably paid for this feast many times over!"
"All right", conceded Sir John, "you've probably got a point there. I tell you what, brother, as you know I have no sons of my own, and to show you that I'm serious about mending my ways, I'll make you my sole heir". Gamelyn, of course, was a bit naive, and was always willing to believe his older brother, so he was very happy with this proposal. Then Sir John scratched his beard, and said, "There is just one thing, young brother. You know when you threw the watchman in the well, I swore that I would have you put in chains. Of course, I don't really want to do that now, but if I don't do something, I could stand accused of perjury, having sworn that I would do so. So for the sake of avoiding perjury, would you be so good as to consent being shackled, just for a short while?" Again, Gamelyn was unable and unwilling to see through his brother's treacherous plan, and readily consented to being bound for a while.
So Sir John called his servants, and instructed them to tie up his brother and shackle him to the great post in the castle's banqueting hall, which Gamelyn readily allowed them to do. Once he was thus tied and shackled, Sir John burst out laughing. "HaHaHa, I've got you now, you young fool!"
There Gamelyn stayed for the rest of the day and night, until finally, after everybody had retired, he was able to attract the attention of the steward, and old fellow called Adam, who had been the castle steward under Gamelyn's father and had known Gamelyn all his life. Luckily, this old servant did not like the new Sir John very much, and wasn't very happy with the way he had been treating Gamelyn. Therefore it was not very difficult for Gamelyn to persuade this old loyal servant to help him. First Adam freed him from his ropes and shackles, and then took the young Gamelyn to his quarters, where first he served him with food and drink. Then they set down to work out a plan. At first Gamelyn proposed that he should go down to Sir John's quarters and cut off his head, but Adam persuaded him that he had a better plan.
Adam explained to Gamelyn that Sir John had arranged a great feast to be held the next day, Sunday, to which he had invited a great many Churchmen, abbots, priors and other so called holy men. "We will appeal to them, if they agree you should be released, nobody needs to know that I've been helping you. If they refuse, I will help you break out of the castle." So they agreed that Gamelyn would be bound onto the great post again, only in such a way that he would easily break free. Adam would keep an eye on the proceedings, and stand at the ready with some weapons should the churchmen refuse to play ball.
After the church service on Sunday, Sir John entered the great hall, which had been set out ready for the feast, with a great number of his guests, and as they were sitting down, Sir John explained that his young brother had gone mad. He'd killed the porter by throwing him into the well, and had attacked others in his household. "I had no choice but to put the poor lad in chains, for his own protection as well as that of my servants and my property", explained Sir John. The churchmen expressed their astonishment at the young man's actions, and agreed that Sir John had taken the right course of action. When Gamelyn spoke up, to try and get them to understand his predicament and to have pity on him, they just ignored his pleadings and mocked him, then carried on eating and drinking, toasting the health of their host. As they had arranged, Adam then brought in some sturdy wooden staves, and Gamelyn easily threw of his shackles, which had only been loosely fixed on him.
The poor churchmen were no match for the young, fit Gamelyn. He laid in them with his stave, knocking them over at will. They tried to escape, but Adam had locked the door to the great hall, and none of the other servants intervened. Nobody liked the churchmen very much, and they were all happy to see them get a good beating. When all the fat churchmen had been knocked down, sideways and over, Gamelyn sought out his brother, Sir John. He'd tried to escape but had found the door locked, and now Gamelyn picked him up easily, threw him down hard and struck him with his stave, breaking his back. Then he dragged him to the post, and bound his brother in the chains that had held him. "You can stay here for a while", he said, "and cool down, while I have something to eat and drink from your sumptuous table." Gamelyn then allowed the door to be opened so the churchmen, with their bruised and broken heads and limbs could make their way home.
Gamelyn and Adam sat down at the table and helped themselves to whatever they fancied, waited on by Sir John's servants, some of whom were greatly impressed by the young Gamelyn's extraordinary display of strength.  After a while however, the new porter came rushing into the hall, and warned them that the sheriff was on his way, with a troop of men. One of the churchmen must have told him what had happened at Sir John's castle. Gamelyn ordered for the gate to the castle to be locked tightly, but he knew that they would have to make a plan. Adam, again, came up with an idea. "We should retreat to the forest", he said. "The sheriff's men will not follow us there."
They selected a couple of good horses from the stables, helped themselves to swords and staves, and rode away, scattering some of the sheriff's men who tried to stop them getting away.
After wandering around in the forest for some time, the two friends eventually came upon a group of outlaws, who had made the forest their home. Their leader was known as "the king of the outlaws", and Gamelyn explained to him why he and Adam had needed to flee to the woods. Some of the men had heard stories about Gamelyn and his wicked brother, and they welcomed him warmly. So it was that Gamelyn and Adam joined the band of outlaws, and lived in the forest undisturbed. The outlaws lived on the wildlife in the forests, but they also robbed the odd traveller. Gamelyn made it a point only to rob Churchmen, and he became known far and wide as the courteous outlaw.
In the meantime, after the sheriff had arrived at the castle, he'd found Sir John tied to the post in the great hall. He freed him, and summoned for a doctor to treat the man's wounds. Sir John recovered soon enough from his injuries and went about making a plan to trap his brother and have him done away with once and for all. He made a deal with the old sheriff, who was getting on in years and wanted to retire anyway, and bought himself the position and title of Sheriff. Then he proclaimed that Gamelyn was a murderer, and put a price on his head. Posters were put out all over the county, listing Gamelyn's crimes and offering a reward for his capture. News of this soon spread to the outlaws in the forest and to Gamelyn's ears. The young man was so angry that he decided to go and visit his brother and challenge him. Adam tried to advise him against this, being sure that if Gamelyn went to the castle on his own, he would surely be arrested, and maybe even killed. But the young man was stubborn and refused to listen to reason. So he went off on his own, to the castle to confront his brother. But it transpired as Adam had predicted. The sheriff's men overpowered him, chained him and threw him in the prison. Sir John was happy, he was sure he would now have the last laugh, and set about preparing for a trial at which he would make sure that his young brother would be found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.
Gamelyn's other brother, Otho, had been living quietly on his own lands, not really aware of the fights between his older and younger brother, but now news reached him of the quarrel between these two, and that Sir John was planning to have Gamelyn hanged. This so saddened Otho, that he went to see Sir John, to plead for his young brother's life. Of course Sir John would not listen, but then Otho suggested that he would stand surety for Gamelyn, if Sir John agreed to release him into his custody. Sir John thought he could not really refuse this offer, but he warned Otho that if Gamelyn did not turn up at the trial, he himself would be given the punishment that Gamelyn would have received. Otho agreed to this, and so it was that Gamelyn was released and delivered into Otho's custody.
After they arrived safely at Otho's home, Gamelyn related to him all that had happened between him and Sir John, and how he had taken shelter in the forest, in the company of the outlaws. Gamelyn asked Otho's permission to go back to the forest, and to see how his friends, especially Adam, were getting on. Otho was reluctant for Gamelyn to go; he pointed out what would happen if Gamelyn did not appear before the judge at the arranged date. But Gamelyn assured him that he would be there, and Otho, being kind and trusting, relented and allowed him to go to the forest.
Gamelyn had a good time with his old friends and fellow outlaws, and the days and weeks just flew by. One morning he realised that the day of the trial must be approaching, and he started to make preparations for his journey back into town. But by now Gamelyn had learned a few things, and he knew he could not trust his brother, the sheriff, or the judge, who he suspected would already have been bribed by Sir John to find him guilty of all the crimes he was accused of, whatever the evidence might say. So he got together a band of willing young outlaws to accompany him, all heavily armed. The loyal old servant Adam was sent ahead as a scout, to find out what the situation was in the town and the courthouse. Gamelyn and his troop of merry outlaws rested a few miles outside of the town, waiting for Adam to bring the news. When Adam turned up, Gamelyn could see immediately that his servant was very upset. It appeared that the Judge was already there, and had Otho arrested and put in jail. Adam was so furious that for once he urged Gamelyn to ride into town and slay everybody who got in the way. But now Gamelyn had a better idea. "We will ride into town, yes," he said, "but we will arrest the judge and his clerks, and we will appoint me as the judge, and you, Adam, will be  my clerk. Then we will meet out some justice."
So they rode into town. Gamelyn sent a few of his men to the jail, where they freed Otho. He himself and the rest of the men rode into the hall where the judge was sitting. The Sheriff's men tried to put up a fight, but Gamelyn and his outlaws were far too strong, and disarmed them fairly easily. They arrested the judge and the sheriff, Sir John, and put them in chains. Gamelyn then took his place in the judge's seat, with Otho beside him, and Adam taking the seat reserved for the clerk of the court. "Now we shall see some justice done", shouted Gamelyn. He called twelve of his young outlaws, and swore them in as jurors. Then he proceeded to lay charges against his brother and the judge: the false imprisonment and attempted murder of his brother Otho and himself. The twelve jurors were unanimous in their verdict: Guilty on all counts. Gamelyn did not want to waste any time, and had Sir John and his corrupt judge hanged there and then.
Gamelyn and Otho knew that in order to live peaceful lives they would have to go and see King Edward, and get his sanction for their actions. They travelled to London, with Adam and a number of the outlaws, and put their case before the king. The king was known to be unhappy with corrupt officials, having had a few problems himself, so after he'd heard their story and the testimony of Adam, he readily pardoned them, and made Otho the new sheriff, and gave Gamelyn the post of royal forester, to look after all the free forests in the county. In return Gamelyn and Otho promised the king their lifelong support and loyalty. So the brothers could return to their homes, with the king's blessings. Gamelyn married a beautiful young maiden, they had many children and lived a long, happy and joyful life.

The town of Stavoren was an old seaport in Holland. A long time ago a merchant lived there, who had a fleet of ships that travelled the world buying goods to bring back to Holland for the merchant to sell. The merchant had become extremely rich, and had built himself a magnificent mansion right on the edge of the water. He was a kind and generous man, who treated his employees very well, and he was always ready to help the poor people in the town.
When he died, the whole town was in mourning for a month. The only person who was secretly glad that he had passed away was his wife. She was a very selfish person, and she had always been very upset whenever her husband had given any money, food or clothes to a poor person. Now she took over the running of the business, and without her husband there, she was able to do things her way. Whenever some poor person came knocking on her door to ask for some help, a bite to eat, or some change, she cursed them and sent them away. "Find some work! Get a job!" she shouted. "You lazy layabouts, you won't get anything from me! I work hard for what I've got and I'm not sharing it with you workshy rabble!"
When she was not in her harbour office, dealing with buyers and her captains, she would be at home in her mansion, counting her money. She had everything she could ever have wished for: a beautiful place to live in, the finest furniture and clothes and all the money in the world. People said that she was richer than the royal household.
But she still wasn't happy. Other rich people had beautiful mansions and fine furniture and silk clothes. She longed for something that nobody else in the world had. Only she didn't know what that was. So one day she called her captains together and instructed them to travel to all the corners of the world and bring her back the most precious objects they could find.
The captains sailed away, and for many long months nothing was heard or seen from them. Then slowly they started returning. One had been to Africa and had found wonderful ivory carvings made from the tusks of elephants. Nobody in the whole town had ever seen such beautiful objects but the old lady was not satisfied.
Another had been all the way to China and brought back colourful silks and green and black jade. Still the old lady was not happy.
Another had been to the East Indies and brought back a variety of spices and herbs that nobody had tasted before, but the old lady dismissed the captain and told him to go out again. Others had been to Arabia, where they found white horses and beautifully crafted gold daggers inlaid with precious stones, to India, where they found tiger skins and fine silver jewellery, to Turkey and Greece, where they found handwoven silk rugs and painted vases. But always the old lady's reaction was the same. She just could not be satisfied.
All the ships had returned except one. The old lady sat in her castle and waited. Then the ship appeared on the horizon. The old lady went down to the harbour to await its arrival. This captain had been around the world, looking for that special elusive something that might make his mistress happy. Then one day, on the Baltic coast, they had come across a warehouse full of the finest purest grain that anybody had ever laid eyes on. It was a wonderful golden colour, and each grain was perfectly shaped, full of the goodness of life. "I've never seen anything as precious as this in my whole life" the captain exclaimed, and all his crew agreed. So they filled the ships hold with this precious grain and set sail for home. But when the old lady boarded the ship, and saw the grain, she was furious. "How dare you!" she screamed. "What an insult, what a waste of money! What am I going to do with this useless grain?" In her fury she ordered the captain to tip his cargo into the sea. He protested that this was valuable grain which would feed the town for months, but she could not be reasoned with. One of the ship's crew, a poor old man, begged her to save some of the grain to give to the poor people in the town. But she refused. "Don't be so stupid", she said, "The poor are poor because they refuse to work!" The old man cursed her; "You will regret this one day", he said, "one day when you will be begging for a crust of bread!"
The old lady laughed dismissively. She pulled a large gold ring from her finger. "You see this ring?" she asked. "I'd rather throw this ring into the sea than give one handful of grain to those layabouts on the shore!" The old man shook his head in sorrow, and then, impetuously, shouting: "Watch me!" the old lady threw the ring into the sea, as far as she could.
The old man looked her in the eye. "One day this ring will come back to you", he said, "and then you will beg!"
The old lady was unrepentant. She sent all her ships out again, with the same instructions, to bring her the most precious and rare objects money could buy.
One day she was at the harbour side, when a fishing boat was unloading its catch. Among the fish she spotted a particularly good looking sea bass. "I want that fish!" she shouted. She paid the fisherman a few coins and instructed him to bring the fish up to her castle. There she instructed her cook to bake it slowly in the oven with some herbs and new potatoes.
A little later she sat down at her dining table, and the cook brought in the fish on a gold platter. She cut the side of the fish, and separated the flesh from the bone. Then, to her horror, there inside the fish was the large gold ring she had thrown into the sea not so long ago. She screamed, and ordered the cook to take away the fish and to throw it out with the rubbish. She saw the image of that old man before her, telling her exactly what would happen. "Never!" she screamed, "I will never beg!"
At exactly that time, black clouds obscured the sky, a terrible storm got up, and it rained for days and days on end. There was so much water that first the mansion flooded, and then the whole town and all the surrounding fields. The power of the water and the wind combined to knock the castle down, and it disappeared into the sea, with all the old lady's wonderful furniture, her fine silks and all her money. When the wind finally calmed, the rain stopped and the waters retreated, there was nothing left of her castle, and half the town was in ruins. The old lady had lost everything, except the clothes she wore. She was cold and hungry, and she suddenly felt very old. Where was she going to get some food? She started walking down the road, looking for a door to knock on. But all the people in the town remembered her meanness and her cruelty, and refused to help her. So she was forced to leave the town, and started roaming the countryside, begging for a crust where she could.

During the time of the animal kingdom, the animals used to have periodic gatherings where they would discuss important questions and elect their kings.
Very often one or two animals would get in front of the crowd and provide some entertainment. Once the monkey gave a particularly inspired performance of dancing, which was greatly appreciated by all the animals who were there. They cheered and applauded him enthusiastically.
A camel was in the audience, and he felt rather envious. He would love to be so adored. This desire made him get up and take his place before the crowd. He began to dance, and he thought he was doing quite well. The audience however thought he looked ridiculous and started booing and calling him names. The camel was so embarrassed that he retired from the meeting and made his way back to the dessert, where he has stayed ever since.

Athenians have always been great travellers. For a time it was the fashion among them to take a pet with them on their travels, for company and amusement. Lapdogs and monkeys were among the favourites.
Once a man was returning to Athens from the East, travelling on a ship with his pet monkey. They came across a great storm, which caused the ship to capsize. Everybody on board scrambled for pieces of floating wreckage to hang onto, some tried to swim, and quite a few drowned. This monkey was not a very good swimmer, and he was thrashing about in the water, and he too would have drowned if he had not been rescued by a dolphin, who, believing him to be a man, took him on his back.
Once the storm calmed a little, the dolphin asked the monkey if he was from Athens. The monkey thought it would be best to pretend to be a man, so he told the dolphin that he did indeed come from a very distinguished family from the city of Athens.
"Then you must know the Piraeus," said the dolphin. Now the Piraeus is the name the Athenians give to their port, but the monkey didn't know this, and thought the dolphin was talking about a family.
So he replied: "Oh indeed, they are very good friends of mine! If you get me home safely, they'll be sure to reward you handsomely!" This reply indicated to the dolphin that he had an imposter on his back, so he dived deep below the surface and the cheating monkey drowned quickly.

A monkey and a fox were travelling together. The monkey was carrying a rucksack containing some crockery and cutlery, and flints to make a fire, and after some time, he was getting rather weary carrying this weight. "You know," he said to the fox, "I shouldn't really be the one carrying this rucksack, you know."
"Why would that be, pray tell, my good friend," asked the fox.
"I am a very noble creature," replied the monkey, "far away in the east, they tell stories of how we monkeys are descended from the Gods!"
"That may well be so," said the fox, "but look at my fur and yours, look at the beautiful colour and the fullness of my tail, compared with that scrawny thing you've got dangling behind you, any impartial observer would judge me to be the more noble creature."
"Ha!" cried the monkey, "Appearances! Everybody knows appearances deceive. Real nobility is inside one's character, one's bearing and one's mind."
The fox laughed. "Sure," he said, "that's why you chose to carry the rucksack when we started out this morning. You knew from my noble bearing that I was far too good to carry the rucksack around on my back!"
Just then they came to a great cemetery, where there were a great number of stone monuments marking the graves. The monkey stopped and looked around him, and then gave a great sigh. The fox too stopped, and sat down, waiting for monkey to speak again.
"All these monuments you see here," monkey said at last, spreading his arms about, "were erected in the distant past to some of my ancestors, who were some of the most eminent men in their day, so that their memories be cherished by generations to come!"
Fox was greatly amused by this statement. "Well sir," he said, "you have me there. You've been very clever in choosing these ancient corpses as your witnesses, because very conveniently for you, none of them is able to stand up and either confirm or deny your claim to nobility!"

There was a time, so the story goes, when all the animals lived together in harmony. The lion didn't chase the oxen, the wolf didn't hunt the sheep, and owls didn't swoop on the mice in the field. Once a year they would get together and choose a king, who would then reign over the animal kingdom for the next twelve months.
Those animals who thought they would like a turn at being king would put themselves forward and would make speeches and give demonstrations of their prowess or their wisdom. Then all the animals gathered together would vote, and the animal with the most votes was crowned king. That's probably where us humans got the idea of elections!
Now, monkey knew very well that he was neither very strong nor very wise, and he was not exactly a great orator, but, boy, could he dance! So he did what he does best, and he danced acrobatically and energetically, performing enormous leaps, back somersaults and cartwheels that truly dazzled his audience. Compared to monkey, the elephant was grave and cumbersome, the lion was powerful and authoritarian, and the snake was sly and sinister.
Nobody who was there remembers exactly how it happened, but somehow monkey scraped through with a clear majority of all the votes cast, and he was announced the king of the animal kingdom for the coming year. Most of the animals seemed quite content with this outcome, because they knew that monkey would not take his duties too seriously and make all kinds of onerous demands on them, or demand too much of a formal show of obedience. But there were some who thought that the election of monkey diminished the stature of the kingship, and one of these was fox; in fact fox was pretty disgusted, and he didn't mind who knew it. So he set about concocting a scheme to make monkey look stupid.
He gathered together some fine fresh fruit from the forest, mangos, figs and dates, and laid them out on a trap he'd found. He waited for the monkey to pass by, and called out to him: "Sire, look at these delicious dainty morsels I discovered here by the wayside. I was tempted to gorge myself on them, but then I remembered fruits are your favourite repast, and I thought I should keep them for you, our beloved king!"
Monkey could not resist either the flattery or the fruit, and just managed to compose himself long enough to whisper a hurried "Why, thank you, Mr Fox" and made a beeline for the fruit. "Swish" and "Clunk" went the trap, and "AAAYYY AAAYYY" went our unfortunate monkey king, the trap firmly clasped around his paw.
Monkey bitterly reproached fox for leading him into such a dangerous situation, but fox just laughed and laughed. "You call yourself king of all the animals," he cried, "and you allow yourself to be taken in just like that!"

Two thieves were prowling around the streets late one night, looking for a house to break into. They were tired and hungry. They weren't very good at their jobs; they usually made far too much noise, so that they would wake up either the house owner, one of the servants, or worse still, a guard dog.
They came across a house that looked dark and empty. "Let's try this one", they said. They crept around the corner, and they were in luck. One of the windows in the back was open, and they climbed inside. They went around the house carefully, in the dark, but they could not find anything. Then one of them stumbled over something, he bent over, and found a cockerel sleeping there. He picked up the bird and quickly put it in his bag. They made their way out of the house and rushed back to their den. "At least we'll be able to fill our stomachs tonight", they said.
One of the thieves started a fire, while the other got the cockerel out of the bag. The bird had woken up in the meantime, and seeing the fire, immediately guessed what was happening. "Please gentlemen", said the cockerel, "please don't kill me. I can be very useful. I crow every morning to wake up the honest folk so they can get to their work bright and early!"
"Exactly!" said the thief who was stoking up the fire. "The likes of you make it impossible for us poor thieves to go about our business and make a living. Into the pot you go!"

Once upon a time there lived an old mother goat in a pretty little cottage on the edge of the forest. She had seven little billy goats, and she loved them all dearly. On occasion she would have to leave the cottage to get food for herself and her kids, and today was one of those occasions. She called all her kids together to give them a little lecture on safety. "Listen carefully, my dear children", she began. "I need to go out to get some food, and I want you all to be very careful because I heard there is a wolf about. If he comes here and sees you out and about he will surely gobble you all up, all of you, your skin, your ears, your teeth, your guts, everything. He is a very crafty wolf, and he may well try to deceive you by disguising himself, so stay inside the house, and don't open the door to anybody!"
"Don't worry, mother, the little goats replied, "we will be really, really, careful, and do everything you say. We won't let anybody in, don't you worry about us!" And so she shooed her seven little billy goats into the cottage, and made sure they locked the front door before she went on her way, into the forest.
I think that wily old wolf must have been hiding behind a tree and watching the old mother goat, because only a few minutes later there was a loud knock on the door. "Who's there?" shouted the oldest of the kids. "Open the door!" wolf replied, "It is your mother and I've got some nice things for all of you!" But the little goats heard the rough voice, and knew that this was not their mother, so they said: "You're not our mother, she has a really nice sweet voice, and you sound all rough and rotten. You must be the wolf, so go away, because we won't open the door!"
So the wolf went away, and thought about how he could disguise his voice. He went to see the bees, and bought a pint of honey, which he downed in one go, to make his voice nice and sweet. Then he went back to the goats' cottage and knocked on the door again. "Open the door, my children", he called out. "It is I, your dear mother, and I've brought some wonderful things for all of you to feast o!" But without thinking, in order to make sure his voice was gentle, the wolf had placed his great big black paws on the window, and the billy goats saw them, and they knew something was wrong. "No, no, no", shouted the oldest billy goat, "our mother does not have great big black paws like that! Hers are dainty. You must be the wolf! We won't open the door for you, ever!"
The wolf went away again and thought how he could disguise his paws. He had a brilliant idea. He rushed round the corner, where the baker lived, and asked him to put some dough on his paws, saying he's hurt his foot running away from a hunter. From there, he ran to the miller, and asked him for some white flour to put on the dough that covered his paws. But the miller was reluctant to do so because he assumed that the wolf was up to one of his tricks. But the wolf growled at the miller fiercely, and said: "Come on, give me some flour or I'll bite your nose off!" So the miller put some flour in a bag, which he gave to the wolf, and immediately locked his door as soon as the wolf had gone on his way. Wolf now rushed back to the cottage, and when he got there, he opened the bag with the flour, and sprinkled it all over the dough that covered his paws. "Now we'll see if those miserable billy goats won't open the door", he muttered to himself.
He knocked on the door for the third tie, calling out: "Open the door, my dear little children, It is your mother, and I've brought something very tasty for you all to eat." The oldest little goat went up to the window and shouted: "Show us your feet, so we can see if you really are our mother". The wolf put his feet, covered in dough and flour, up against the window. "You see?" he asked. "it really is me, your mother, this time". That's how the billy goats were tricked into believing it really was their mother outside the door, and the oldest billy goat carefully opened the door. Immediately the wolf burst in, with a great howl in that rough voice of his, and the little goats started screaming and scrambling for places to hide in the little cottage. One tried to hide under the table, but the wolf found him and gobbled him up. A second tried to hide behind the cooker, but the wolf found him and gobbled him up. The third hid in the pantry, but the wolf found him and gobbled him up. The fourth hid behind his mother's easy chair, but the wolf found him and gobbled him up. The fifth hid under the bed covers, but the wolf found him and gobbled him up. The sixth tried to hide in the wash tub, but the wolf found him too, and gobbled him up. Only the seventh, the youngest and smallest one, who managed to hide behind the old grandfather clock, escaped. When he couldn't find anybody else, the wolf grumbled, "I really can't remember how many of them there were in here, was it six or seven? I can't remember how many of them I've already gobbled up!" He laughed, and rubbed his stomach. "I'm pretty full, anyway, he said, I'll go and have a little lie down, if there are any left, I will catch them later, that's for sure!"
So he sauntered outside, found a nice cosy place under an apple tree, and went to sleep. It did not take long before he was snoring loudly.
Eventually old mother goat returned with her shopping, and to her consternation, she saw that the front door to the cottage was wide open. She ran inside and started crying; what a mess, all the furniture was upside down, the wash tub had rolled over, and the bed covers were on top of the cooker. She knew that this could only mean one thing: the wolf had been in here and had taken all her children. She groaned and she wailed. But then she heard a little voice coming from a corner of the room: "Mummy is that you?"   She stopped crying, and replied: "it's me, where are you? What happened here?" Then the littlest of her children came out from his hiding place behind the grandfather clock, and told her everything that had happened. "oh dear, oh dear", the old mother goat cried, "what a calamity!!" She decided to have a look outside to see if any of the others might have got away, and there, under the apple tree, she saw the bulky figure of the old wolf, fast asleep and snoring like he had swallowed a few pints of schnapps. She went up close to him, and she saw that there was some movement inside the wolf's stomach. That made her think that her children might still be alive, inside that horrible creature. She rushed into the kitchen, and got a big pair of scissors. She proceeded to cut open the wolf's stomach, and as the hole she was cutting got bigger, she could see one head, that came sticking out, then a tail, and then a leg. She cut as fast and as far as she could, and before long, her six children jumped out of the wolf's stomach, one after the other. The old mother was filled with joy. That nasty wolf had been so greedy that he had just gulped them all down, without chewing, so that not only were they still alive, but they were all in one piece!
She rushed inside again, and came back with a great big needle and some thread. She told her children to go and fetch some large stones. "We'll fill up his stomach with stones, she explained, and then we'll stitch him up again. That will teach him a lesson!" each of the little billy goats soon came back with a big stone, as big as they could carry, and old mother goat deposited them all inside the wolf's stomach. Once that was done, she proceeded to stitch him up again, and when that was finished, they all went inside the cottage, where they all sat by the window and watched and waited for the wolf to wake up.
Eventually the wolf did wake up. He felt rather tired and heavy, especially heavy. And thirsty, boy, was he thirsty! With great difficulty he managed to raise himself, and started tottering towards the brook, moaning and groaning all the while. "Oh boy, oh boy, I am so thirsty, I could drink a whole river!" Eventually he came to the brook, and lowered his head to take a drink. But he was so heavy, what with all these stones in his stomach, that he just slid down the bank and straight into the water, where he disappeared below the surface, and drowned.
The old mother goat and her seven little billy goats had followed the wolf at a safe distance, and when they saw the nasty creature disappear beneath the waves of the rook, they all started singing and dancing: "The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead, our dear mother tricked the wolf and now he is dead! Hurrah, hurrah!" old mother goat called all her children together. "Now listen to me, she began, first we'll go and clean up the house, then we'll have a big party with some of the wonderful things I brought back from the forest to celebrate that we all survived this adventure!" And the seven little billy goats had the best ever party of their lives!

In old times, when wishing was having, there lived a King whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face.
Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest, was a fountain. When the day was very warm, the King's Child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up in the air and caught it. And this ball was her favorite plaything.
Now, it so happened one day, the King's Daughter's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground, and rolled straight into the water. The King's Daughter followed it with her eyes; but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not14 be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted.
And as she thus lamented, some one said to her, "What ails you, King's Daughter? You weep so that even a stone would show pity."
She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a Frog stretching its thick, ugly head from the water. "Ah! old water-splasher, is it you?" said she; "I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the fountain."
"Be quiet, and do not weep," answered the Frog, "I can help you. But what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?"
"Whatever you will have, dear Frog," said she"my clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing."
The Frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels, or your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion and playfellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your little bedif you will promise me this, I will go down below, and bring your golden ball up again."
"Oh, yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring my ball back again." She, however, thought, "How the silly Frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!"
But the Frog, when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down. In a short time he came15 swimming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's Daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it.
"Wait, wait," said the Frog. "Take me with you. I can't run as you can." But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor Frog, who was forced to go back into his fountain again.
The next day, when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase. When it got to the top, it knocked at the door, and cried:
"King's Daughter, youngest.
Open the door!"
She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the Frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.
The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My Child, what are you so afraid of? Is there a Giant outside who wants to carry you away?"
"Ah, no," replied she, "it is no Giant, but a disgusting Frog."
"What does the Frog want with you?"
"Ah, dear Father, yesterday when I was in the forest sitting by the fountain, playing, my golden ball fell into the16 water. And because I cried so, the Frog brought it out again for me. And because he insisted so on it, I promised him he should be my companion; but I never thought he would be able to come out of the water! And now he is here, and wants to come in."
In the meantime, it knocked a second time, and cried:
"King's Daughter, youngest!
Open to me!
Don't you remember yesterday,
And all that you to me did say,
Beside the cooling fountain's spray?
King's Daughter, youngest!
Open to me!"
Then said the King, "That which you have promised you must perform. Go and let him in."
She went and opened the door, and the Frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat still and cried, "Lift me up beside you."
She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the Frog was once on the chair, he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table, he said, "Now, push your little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together."
She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The Frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took, choked her.
At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied. Now I am tired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed ready; and we will both lie down and go to sleep."
The King's Daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the17 cold Frog, which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed.
But the King grew angry and said, "He who helped you when you were in trouble, ought not afterward to be despised."
So she took hold of the Frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed, he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as you; lift me up or I will tell your father."
Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall.
"Now, you will be quiet, odious Frog," said she.
But when he fell down, he was no Frog but a King's Son with beautiful kind eyes!
He, by her father's will, was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked Witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the fountain but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.
Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a coach came rolling up drawn by eight white horses, with white ostrich feathers on their heads. They were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant, Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a Frog, that he had three iron bands laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness.
The coach was to conduct the young King into his kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance.18 And when they had driven a part of the way, the King's Son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried:
"Henry, the coach does break!"
"No, no, my lord, you do mistake!
It is the band around my heart,
That felt such great and bitter smart,
When you were in the fountain strange,
When you into a Frog were changed!"
Again and once again, while they were on their way, something cracked; and each time the King's Son thought the carriage was breaking. But it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.

There was once on a time, an old Goat who had seven little Kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.
One day, she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said, "Dear Children, I have to go into the forest. Be on your guard against the Wolf. If he come in, he will devour you allskin, hair, and all. The wretch often disguises himself; but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet."
The Kids said, "Dear Mother, we will take good care of ourselves. You may go away without any anxiety."
Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door, and cried, "Open the door, dear Children! Your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you."
But the little Kids knew that it was the Wolf, by his rough voice. "We will not open the door," cried they; "you are not20 our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough. You are the Wolf!"
Then the Wolf went away to a shopkeeper, and bought a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and cried, "Open the door, dear Children! Your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you."
But the Wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them, and cried, "We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you. You are the Wolf!"
Then the Wolf ran to a baker, and said, "I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me."
And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, "Strew some white meal over my feet for me." The miller thought to himself, "The Wolf wants to deceive some one," and refused. But the Wolf said, "If you will not do it, I will devour you." Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Yes! so are men!
Now, the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it, and said, "Open the door for me, Children! Your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something from the forest with her."
The little Kids cried, "First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother."
Then he put his paws in through the window. And when the Kids saw that they were white, they believed all that he said, and opened the door. But who should come in but the Wolf!
THE LITTLE KIDS CRIED, "FIRST SHOW US YOUR PAWS"
They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the Wolf found them all and made no delay, but swallowed one after the other down his throat. The youngest in the clock-case was the only one he did not find.
When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.
Soon afterward, the old Goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed.
She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she called the youngest, a soft voice cried, "Dear Mother, I am in the clock-case."
She took the Kid out, and it told her that the Wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children!
At length, in her grief she went out, and the youngest Kid ran with her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the Wolf by the tree and he was snoring so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his stomach. "Ah!" said she, "is it possible that my poor children, whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?"
Then the Kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the Goat cut open the monster's stomach. Hardly had she made one cut, than a little Kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no hurt whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them whole.
What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said, "Now go and look for some big stones. We will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them, while he is asleep."
Then the seven Kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in. And the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste; so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.
When the Wolf had had his sleep out, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:
"What rumbles and tumbles
Against my poor bones?
I thought 'twas six Kids,
But it's only big stones!"
And when he got to the well and stooped over the water and was just about to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in. There was no help for it, but he had to drown miserably!
When the seven Kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud, "The Wolf is dead! The Wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.

Four Bulls, which had entered into a very strict friendship, kept always near one another, and fed together. The Lion often saw them, and as often had a mind to make one of them his prey; but, though he could easily have subdued any of them singly, yet he was afraid to attack the whole alliance, as knowing they would have been too hard for him, and therefore contented himself, for the present, with keeping at a distance.
At last, perceiving no attempt was to be made upon them, as long as this combination held, he took occasion, by whispers and hints, to foment jealousies, and raise divisions among them. This stratagem succeeded so well, that the Bulls grew cold and reserved towards one another, which soon after ripened into a downright hatred and aversion; and, at last, ended in a total separation. The Lion had now obtained his ends;
and, as impossible as it was for him to hurt them while they were united, he found no difficulty, now they were parted, to seize and devour every Bull of them, one after another.

A Frog, leaping out of a lake, and taking the advantage of a rising ground, made proclamation to all the beasts of the forest, that he was an able physician, and, for curing all manner of distempers, would turn his back to no person living. This discourse, uttered in a parcel of hard, cramp words, which nobody understood, made the beasts admire his learning, and give credit to every thing he said.
At last the Fox, who was present, with indignation asked him, how he could have the impudence, with those thin lantern-jaws, that meagre pale phiz, and blotched spotted body, to set up for one who was able to cure the infirmities of others.

An Eagle that had young ones, looking out for something to feed them with, happened to spy a Fox's cub, that lay basking itself abroad in the sun. She made a stoop, and trussed it immediately; but before she had carried it quite off, the old Fox coming home, implored her, with tears in her eyes, to spare her cub, and pity the distress of a poor fond mother, who should think no affliction so great as that of losing her child.
The Eagle, whose nest was up in a very high tree, thought herself secure enough from all projects of revenge, and so bore away the cub to her young ones, without showing any regard to the supplications of the Fox. But that subtle creature, highly incensed at this outrageous barbarity, ran to an altar, where some country people had been sacrificing a kid in the open fields, and catching up a firebrand in her mouth,
made towards the tree where the Eagle's nest was, with a resolution of revenge. She had scarce ascended the first branches, when the Eagle, terrified with the approaching ruin of herself and family, begged of the Fox to desist, and, with much submission, returned her the cub again safe and sound.

A fowler took his gun, and went into the woods a-shooting. He spied a Ring-Dove among the branches of an oak, and intended to kill it. He clapped the piece to his shoulder, and took his aim accordingly. But, just as he was going to pull the trigger, an adder, which he had trod upon under the grass, stung him so painfully in the leg, that he was forced to quit his design, and threw his gun down in a passion.
The poison immediately infected his blood, and his whole body began to mortify; which, when he perceived, he could not help owning it to be just. 'Fate,' says he, 'has brought destruction upon me, while I was contriving the death of another.'

A Sow had just farrowed, and lay in the stye, with her whole litter of pigs about her. A Wolf who longed for one of them, but knew not how to come at it, endeavoured to insinuate himself into the Sow's good opinion: and, accordingly, coming up to her'How does the good woman in the straw do?' says he. 'Can I be of any service to you, Mrs. Sow, in relation to your little family here?
If you have a mind to go abroad, and air yourself a little, or so, you may depend upon it, I will take as much care of your pigs as you could yourself.''Your humble servant,' says the Sow, 'I thoroughly understand your meaning; and, to let you know I do, I must be so free as to tell you, I had rather have your room than your company; and, therefore, if you would act like a Wolf of honour, and oblige me, I beg I may never see your face again.'

A Wolf meeting a Lamb, one day, in company with a Goat'Child,' says he, 'you are mistaken; this is none of your mother; she is yonder;' pointing to a flock of sheep at a distance.'It may be so,' says the Lamb; 'the person that happened to conceive me, and afterwards bore me a few months in her belly, because she could not help it, and then dropped me, she did not care where, and left me to the wide world, is, I suppose, what you call my mother;
but I look upon this charitable Goat as such, that took compassion on me in my poor, helpless, destitute condition, and gave me suck; sparing it out of the mouths of her own kids, rather than I should want it.''But sure,' says he, 'you have a greater regard for her that gave you life, than for any body else.''She gave me life! I deny that. She that could not so much as tell whether I should be black or white, had a great hand in giving me life, to be sure!
But, supposing it were so, I am mightily obliged to her, truly, for contriving to let me be of the male-kind, so that I go every day in danger of the butcher. What reason then have I to have a greater regard for one to whom I am so little indebted for any part of my being, than for those from whom I have received all the benevolence and kindness which have hitherto supported me in life?'

A Kite, who had kept sailing in the air for many days near a dove-house, and made a stoop at several pigeons, but all to no purpose (for they were too nimble for him), at last had recourse to stratagem, and took his opportunity one day to make a declaration to them, in which he set forth his own just and good intentions, who had nothing more at heart than the defence and protection of the Pigeons in their ancient rights and liberties,
and how concerned he was at their fears and jealousies of a foreign invasion, especially their unjust and unreasonable suspicions of himself, as if he intended, by force of arms, to break in upon their constitution, and erect a tyrannical government over them. To prevent all which, and thoroughly to quiet their minds, he thought proper to propose to them such terms of alliance and articles of peace as might for ever cement a good understanding between them:
the principal of which was, that they should accept of him for their king, and invest him with all kingly privilege and prerogative over them. The poor simple Pigeons consented: the Kite took the coronation oath, after a very solemn manner, on his part, and the Doves, the oaths of allegiance and fidelity, on theirs. But much time had not passed over their heads, before the good Kite pretended that it was part of his prerogative to devour a Pigeon whenever he pleased.
And this he was not contented to do himself only, but instructed the rest of the royal family in the same kingly arts of government. The Pigeons, reduced to this miserable condition, said one to the other, 'Ah! we deserve no better! Why did we let him come in!

An honest, plain, sensible Country Mouse, is said to have entertained at his hole one day a fine Mouse of the Town. Having formerly been playfellows together, they were old acquaintance, which served as an apology for the visit. However, as master of the house, he thought himself obliged to do the honours of it, in all respects, and to make as great a stranger of his guest as he possibly could. In order to this, he set before him a reserve of delicate grey peas and bacon,
a dish of fine oatmeal, some parings of new cheese, and, to crown all with a dessert, a remnant of a charming mellow apple. In good manners, he forbore to eat any himself, lest the stranger should not have enough; but, that he might seem to bear the other company, sat and nibbled a piece of a wheaten straw very busily. At last says the spark of the town, 'Old crony, give me leave to be a little free with you; how can you bear to live in this nasty, dirty, melancholy hole here,
with nothing but woods and meadows, and mountains, and rivulets, about you? Do not you prefer the conversation of the world to the chirping of birds, and the splendour of a court to the rude aspect of an uncultivated desert! Come, take my word for it, you will find it a change for the better. Never stand considering, but away this moment. Remember, we are not immortal, and therefore have no time to lose. Make sure of to-day, and spend it as agreeably as you can; you know not what may happen to-morrow.'
In short, these and such like arguments prevailed, and his Country Acquaintance was resolved to go to town that night. So they both set out upon their journey together, proposing to sneak in after the close of the evening. They did so; and, about midnight, made their entry into a certain great house, where there had been an extraordinary entertainment the day before, and several tit-bits, which some of the servants had purloined, were hid under the seat of a window.
The Country Guest was immediately placed in the midst of a rich Persian carpet: and now it was the Courtier's turn to entertain; who, indeed, acquitted himself in that capacity with the utmost readiness and address, changing the courses as elegantly, and tasting every thing first as judiciously, as any clerk of a kitchen, the other sat and enjoyed himself like a delighted epicure, tickled to the last degree with this new turn of his affairs; when, on a sudden,
a noise of somebody opening the door made them start from their seats, and scuttle in confusion about the dining-room. Our Country Friend, in particular, was ready to die with fear at the barking of a huge mastiff or two, which opened their throats just about the same time, and made the whole house echo. At last, recovering himself'Well,' says he, 'if this be your town life, much good may do you with it: give me my poor quiet hole again, with my homely, but comfortable, grey peas.'

The Lion and several other beasts entered into an alliance, offensive and defensive, and were to live very sociably together in the forest. One day, having made a sort of an excursion by way of hunting, they took a very fine, large, fat deer, which was divided into four parts; there happening to be then present his majesty the Lion, and only three others. After the division was made, and the parts were set out, his majesty advancing forward some steps, and pointing to one of the shares,
was pleased to declare himself after the following manner: 'This I seize and take possession of as my right, which devolves to me, as I am descended by a true, lineal, hereditary succession from the royal family of Lion: that (pointing to the second) I claim by, I think, no unreasonable demand; considering that all the engagements you have with the enemy turn chiefly upon my courage and conduct; and you very well know, that wars are too expensive to be carried on without proper supplies.
Then (nodding his head towards the third) that I shall take by virtue of my prerogative; to which, I make no question, but so dutiful and loyal a people will pay all the deference and regard that I can desire. Now, as for the remaining part, the necessity of our present affairs is so very urgent, our stock so low, and our credit so impaired and weakened, that I must insist upon your granting that, without any hesitation or demur; and hereof fail not at your peril.'

Once upon a time there commenced a fierce war between the Birds and the Beasts; when the Bat, taking advantage of his ambiguous make hoped, by that means, to live secure in a state of neutrality, and save his bacon. It was not long before the forces on each side met, and gave battle; and, their animosities running very high, a bloody slaughter ensued. The Bat, at the beginning of the day, thinking the birds most likely to carry it, listed himself among them; but kept fluttering at a little distance,
that he might the better observe, and take his measures accordingly. However, after some time spent in the action, the army of the Beasts seeming to prevail, he went entirely over to them, and endeavoured to convince them, by the affinity which he had to a Mouse, that he was by nature a beast, and would always continue firm and true to their interest. His plea was admitted; but, in the end, the advantage turning completely on the side of the Birds, under the admirable conduct and courage of their general the Eagle,
the Bat, to save his life, and escape the disgrace of falling into the hands of his deserted friends, betook himself to flight; and ever since, skulking in caves and hollow trees all day, as if ashamed to show himself, he never appears till the dusk of the evening, when all the feathered inhabitants of the air are gone to roost.

A skilful archer coming into the woods, directed his arrows so successfully, that he slew many wild beasts, and pursued several others. This put the whole savage kind into a fearful consternation, and made them fly to the most retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger resumed a courage, and, bidding them not to be afraid, said, that he alone would engage the enemy; telling them, they might depend upon his valour and strength to revenge their wrongs. In the midst of these threats, while he was lashing himself with his tail,
and tearing up the ground for anger, an arrow pierced his ribs, and hung by its barbed point in his side. He set up an hideous and loud roar, occasioned by the anguish which he felt, and endeavoured to draw out the painful dart with his teeth; when the Fox, approaching him, inquired with an air of surprise, who it was that could have strength and courage enough to wound so mighty and valorous a beast?'Ah!' says the Tiger, 'I was mistaken in my reckoning: it was that invincible man yonder.'

The Lioness and the Fox meeting together fell into discourse; and the conversation turning upon the breeding and the fruitfulness of some living creatures above others, the Fox could not forbear taking the opportunity of observing to the Lioness, that, for her part, she thought Foxes were as happy in that respect as almost any other creatures; for that they bred constantly once a year, if not oftener, and always had a good litter of cubs at every birth: 'and yet,' says she, 'there are those who are never delivered of more than one at a time,
and that perhaps not above once or twice through their whole life, who hold up their noses, and value themselves so much upon it, that they think all other creatures beneath them, and scarce worthy to be spoken to.' The Lioness, who all the while perceived at whom this reflection pointed, was fired with resentment, and with a good deal of vehemence replied'What you have observed may be true, and that not without reason. You produce a great many at a litter, and often; but what are they?Foxes. I indeed have but one at a time;
but you should remember that this one is a Lion.'

You must know that once upon a time Reynard the Fox and Bruin the Bear went into partnership and kept house together. Would you like to know the reason? Well, Reynard knew that Bruin had a beehive full of honeycomb, and that was what he wanted. But Bruin kept so close a guard upon his honey that Master Reynard didn't know how to get away from him and get hold of the honey.
So one day he said to Bruin, "Pardner, I have to go and be gossip -- that means godfather, you know -- to one of my old friends."
"Why, certainly," said Bruin. So off Reynard goes into the woods, and after a time he crept back and uncovered the beehive and had such a feast of honey.
Then he went back to Bruin, who asked him what name had been given to the child. Reynard had forgotten all about the christening and could only say, "Just-Begun."
"What a funny name," said Master Bruin.
A little while after, Reynard thought he would like another feast of honey. So he told Bruin that he had to go to another christening. And off he went. And when he came back and Bruin asked him what was the name given to the child, Reynard said, "Half-Eaten."
The third time the same thing occurred, and this time the name given by Reynard to the child that didn't exist was "All-Gone." You can guess why.
A short time afterwards, Master Bruin thought he would like to eat up some of his honey and asked Reynard to come and join him in the feast. When they got to the beehive, Bruin was so surprised to find that there was no honey left, and he turned round to Reynard and said, "Just-Begun, Half-Eaten, All-Gone. So that is what you meant. You have eaten my honey."
"Why no," said Reynard. "How could that be?" I have never stirred from your side except when I went a-gossiping, and then I was far away from here. You must have eaten the honey yourself, perhaps when you were asleep. At any rate we can easily tell. Let us lie down here in the sunshine, and if either of us has eaten the honey, the sun will soon sweat it out of us."
No sooner said than done, and the two lay side by side in the sunshine. Soon Master Bruin commenced to doze, and Mr. Reynard took some honey from the hive and smeared it round Bruin's snout. Then he woke him up and said, "See, the honey is oozing out of your snout. You must have eaten it when you were asleep."

It happened that the cat met Mr. Fox in the woods. She thought, "He is intelligent and well experienced, and is highly regarded in the world," so she spoke to him in a friendly manner, "Good-day, my dear Mr. Fox. How is it going? How are you? How are you getting by in these hard times?"
The fox, filled with arrogance, examined the cat from head to feet, and for a long time did not know whether he should give an answer. At last he said, "Oh, you poor beard-licker, you speckled fool, you hungry mouse hunter, what are you thinking? Have you the nerve to ask how I am doing? What do you know? How many tricks do you understand?"
"I understand only one," answered the cat, modestly.
"What kind of a trick is it?" asked the fox.
"When the dogs are chasing me, I can jump into a tree and save myself."
"Is that all?" said the fox. "I am master of a hundred tricks, and in addition to that I have a sackful of cunning. I feel sorry for you. Come with me, and I will teach you how one escapes from the dogs."
Just then a hunter came by with four dogs. The cat jumped nimbly up a tree, and sat down at its top, where the branches and foliage completely hid her.
"Untie your sack, Mr. Fox, untie your sack," the cat shouted to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast.
"Oh, Mr. Fox," shouted the cat. "You and your hundred tricks are left in the lurch. If you had been able to climb like I can, you would not have lost your life."

When the chief of the Bonna Dearriga was on his deathbed he gave his son three counsels, and said misfortune would attend him if he did not follow them. The first was never to bring home a beast from a fair after having been offered a fair price for it; the second, never to call in ragged clothes on a friend when he wanted a favor from him; the third not to marry a wife with whose family he was not well acquainted.
The name of the young chief was Illan, called Don, from his brown hair, and the first thing he set about doing after the funeral, was to test the wisdom of his father's counsels. So he went to the fair of Tailtean with a fine mare of his, and rode up and down. He asked twenty gold rings for his beast, but the highest bid he got was only nineteen. To work out his design he would not abate a screpal, but rode home on her back in the evening.
He could have readily crossed a ford that lay in his way near home; for sheer devilment he leaped the river higher up, where the banks on both sides were steep. The poor beast stumbled as she came near the edge, and was flung head foremost into the rocky bed, and killed. He was pitched forward, but his fall was broken by some shrubs that were growing in the face of the opposite bank. He was as sorry for the poor mare as any young fellow, fond of horses and dogs, could be. When he got home he sent a giolla to take off the animal's two forelegs at the knee, and these he hung up in the great hall of his dun, having first had them properly dried and prepared.
Next day he repaired again to the fair, and got into conversation with a rich chief of Oriel, whose handsome daughter had come to the meeting to purchase some cows. Illan offered his services, as he knew most of the bodachs and the bodachs' wives who were there for the object of selling. A word to them from the handsome and popular young chief, and good bargains were given to the lady. So pleased was her father, ay and she too, with this civility that he forthwith received an invitation to hunt and fish at the northern rath, and very willingly he accepted it. So he returned home in a very pleasant state of mind, and was anxious that this second experiment should succeed better than the first.
The visit was paid, and in the mornings there were pleasant walks in the woods with the young lady, while her little brother and sister were chasing one another through the trees, and the hunting and fishing went on afterwards, and there were feasts of venison, and wild boar, and drinking of wine and mead in the evenings, and stories in verse recited by bards, and sometimes moonlight walks on the ramparts of the fort, and at last marriage was proposed and accepted.
One morning as Illan was musing on the happiness that was before him, an attendant on his promised bride walked into his room.
"Great must be your surprise, O Illan Don," said she, "at this my visit, but my respect for you will not allow me to see you fall into the pit that is gaping for you. Your affianced bride is an unchaste woman. You have remarked the deformed Fergus Rua, who plays on the small clarsech, and is the possessor of thrice fifty stories. He often attends in her room late in the evening to play soft music to her, and to put her to sleep with this soft music and his stories of the Danaan druids. Who would suspect the weak deformed creature, or the young lady of noble birth? By your hand, O Illan of the brown hair, if you marry her, you will bring disgrace on yourself and your clan. You do not trust my words! Then trust to your own senses. She would most willingly break off all connection with the lame wretch since she first laid eyes on you, but he has sworn to expose her before you and her father. When the household is at rest this night, wait at the entrance of the passage that leads to the women's apartments. I will meet you there. Tomorrow morning you will require no one's advice for your direction."
Before the sun tinged the purple clouds, next morning, Illan was crossing the outer moat of the lios, and lying behind him on the back of his trusty steed, was some long object carefully folded in skins.
"Tell your honored chief," said he to the attendant who was conducting him, "that I am obliged on a sudden to depart, and that I request him by his regard for me to return my visit a fortnight hence, and to bring his fair daughter with him."
On he rode, and muttered from time to time, "Oh, had I slain the guilty pair, it would be a well merited death! the deformed wretch! the weak lost woman! Now for the third trial!"
Illan had a married sister, whose rath was about twelve of our miles distant from his. To her home he repaired next day, changing clothes with a beggar whom he met on the road. When he arrived, he found that they were at dinner, and several neighboring families with them in the great hall.
"Tell my sister," said he to a giolla who was lounging at the door, "that I wish to speak with her."
"Who is your sister?" said the other in an insolent tone, for he did not recognize the young chief in his beggar's dress.
"Who should she be but the Bhan a Teagh, you rascal!"
The fellow began to laugh, but the open palm of the irritated young man coming like a sledge stroke on his cheek, dashed him on the ground, and set him a-roaring.
"Oh, what has caused this confusion?" said the lady of the house, coming out from the hall.
"I," said her brother, "punishing your giolla's disrespect."
"Oh, brother, what has reduced you to such a condition?"
"An attack on my house, and a creagh made on my lands in my absence. I have neither gold nor silver vessels in my dun, nor rich cloaks, nor ornaments, nor arms for my followers. My cattle have been driven from my lands, and all as I was on a visit at the house of my intended bride. You must come to my relief; you will have to send cattle to my ravaged fields, gold and silver vessels, and ornaments and furs, and rich clothes to my house, to enable me to receive my bride and her father in a few days."
"Poor dear Illan!" she answered, "my heart bleeds for you. I fear I cannot aid you, nor can I ask you to join our company within in these rags. But you must be hungry; stay here till I send you some refreshment."
She quitted him, and did not return again, but an attendant came out with a griddle cake in one hand, and a porringer with some Danish beer in it in the other. Illan carried them away to the spot where he had quitted the beggar, and gave him the bread, and made him drink the beer. Then changing clothes with him, he rewarded him, and returned home, bearing the porringer as a trophy.
On the day appointed with the father of his affianced, there were assembled in Illan's hall, his sister, his sister's husband, his affianced, her father, and some others.
When an opportunity offered after meat and bread, and wine had gone the way of all food, Illan addressed his guests: "Friends and relations, I am about confessing some of my faults before you, and hope you will be bettered by the hearing. My dying father charged me never to refuse a fair offer for horse, cow, or sheep, at a fair. For refusing a trifle less than I asked for my noble mare, there was nothing left to me but those bits of her forelegs you see hanging by the wall. He advised me never to put on an air of want when soliciting a favor. I begged help of my sister for a pretended need, and because I had nothing better than a beggar's cloak on me, I got nothing for my suit but the porringer that you see dangling by the poor remains of my mare. I wooed a strange lady to be my wife, contrary to my dying father's injunction, and after seeming to listen favorably to my suit, she at last said I should be satisfied with the crutches of her lame and deformed harper: there they are!"
The sister blushed, and was ready to sink through the floor for shame. The bride was in a much more wretched state, and would have fainted, but it was not the fashion of the day. Her father stormed, and said this was but a subterfuge on the part of Illan. He deferred to her pleasure, but though torn with anguish for the loss of the young chief's love and respect, she took the blame on herself.
The next morning saw the rath without a visitor; but within a quarter of a year, the kind faced, though not beautiful daughter of a neighboring Duine Uasal (gentleman) made the fort cheerful by her presence. Illan had known her since they were children. He was long aware of her excellent qualities, but had never thought of her as a wife till the morning after his speech. He was fonder of her a month after his marriage than he was on the marriage morning, and much fonder when a year had gone by, and presented his house with an heir.

A tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble. The Eagle agreed, and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons, soared aloft. On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: Tortoise is good eating. The shell is too hard, said the Eagle in reply. The rocks will soon crack the shell, was the Crows answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal off the Tortoise.

Once upon a time there was a father who had three sons. He sent two of them out to find brides for themselves, but the third one, stupid Hansl, was to stay home and feed the animals. He was not satisfied with this, so the father finally said, "Just go. You can look for a bride too."
So Hansl left, and he came to a great forest. On the other side of the forest there was a pond. A frog was sitting on the pond's bank, and it asked, "Now there, Hansl, where are you going?"
"Oh, I'm looking for a bride!"
"Marry me!" said the frog, and this was all right with Hansl, because he did not know where he might find a bride. The frog jumped into the pond, and Hansl went back home.
His brothers were already there, and they wanted to know if the fool had found a bride. "Yes," said Hansl, "I have one already!"
The next day the father gave each one a bundle of flax, saying, "I will give the house to the one of you whose bride can spin the most beautiful yarn in three days." Then each one left, including Hansl.
The frog was again sitting on the bank of the pond. "Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"
"To you. Can you spin?"
"Yes," said the frog. Just tie the flax onto my back."
Hansl did this, and the frog jumped into the pond. One strand of flax was sticking out below and the other one above. "Too bad about the flax. It's gone," thought Hans, and he sadly went back home.
But nonetheless, on the third day he returned to the pond. The frog was again sitting on the bank, and it asked, "Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"
"Have you spun?"
"Yes," said the frog, hopped into the pond, and returned with a skein of yarn that was more beautifully spun than any other. Hans was happy, and he joyfully ran back home, and he did indeed have the most beautiful yarn.
The brothers complained, and then the father said, "I will give the house to the one of you who brings home the most beautiful bride."
The brothers left once again, but this time Hansl took a water jug with him. The other two wanted to know, "Why are you taking a water jug with you?"
"To put my bride in."
The two laughed, "He must have some beautiful bride!"
The frog was already sitting next to the pond. "Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"
"Today I am coming for you!"
Then the frog jumped into the pond and came back with three keys. "Go up there," it said. "There is a castle up there. One of these three keys unlocks the living room, one unlocks the stall, and one unlocks the carriage house. In the living room there are three robes: a red one, a green one, and a white one. In the stall there are two white horses, two black ones, and two brown ones. In the carriage house are three coaches: one of gold, one of silver, and one of glass. In each place you can take what you want."
Once in the castle Hansl first tried on the red robe, but he did not like it: "It makes me look like a butcher." He did not like the green one either: "It makes me look like a hunter." The white one suited him well. Then he went to the stall and took the brown horses. In the carriage house he first wanted to take the golden coach, but it was too lordly for him. The silver one was too heavy, so he took the glass one. He hitched up the brown horses and drove to the pond.
A beautiful young woman was standing there. She said, "You have redeemed me. If you had taken the best thing in each place then I would have had to remain a frog. And the great forest is a fruit orchard, and the pond is a rose garden. All this belongs to you. Let your brothers have the house. You can marry anyone you want to."
"No, you must come with me, so that my father and my brothers can see you." So she rode off with him.
The father and the brothers were amazed when they saw Hansl with the beautiful young woman in the coach. But she suddenly disappeared and flew into the air as a white dove. Hansl gave the house to his brothers. He married a woman from his estate and was very happy. And if he hasn't died, then he still must be alive.

Once on a time there was a king who had twelve sons. When they were grown big he told them they must go out into the world and win themselves wives, but these wives must each be able to spin, and weave, and sew a shirt in one day, else he wouldn't have them for daughters-in-law.
To each he gave a horse and a new suit of mail, and they went out into the world to look after their brides; but when they had gone a bit of the way, they said they wouldn't have Boots, their youngest brother, with them. He wasn't fit for anything.
Well, Boots had to stay behind, and he didn't know what to do or whither to turn; and so he grew so downcast, he got off his horse, and sat down in the tall grass to weep. But when he had sat a little while, one of the tufts in the grass began to stir and move, and out of it came a little white thing, and when it came nearer, Boots saw it was a charming little lassie, only such a tiny bit of a thing. So the lassie went up to him, and asked if he would come down below and see "Doll i' the Grass."
Yes, he'd be very happy; and so he went.
Now, when he got down, there sat Doll i' the Grass on a chair. She was so lovely and so smart, and she asked Boots wither he was going, and what was his business.
So he told her how there were twelve brothers of them, and how the king had given them horse and mail, and said they must each go out into the world and find them a wife who could spin, and weave, and sew a shirt in a day. "But if you'll only say at once you'll be my wife, I'll not go a step farther," said Boots to Doll i' the Grass.
Well, she was willing enough, and so she made haste and span, and wove, and sewed the shirt, but it was so tiny, tiny little. It wasn't longer than so ---- long.
So Boots set off home with it, but when he brought it out he was almost ashamed, it was so small. Still the king said he should have her, and so Boots set off, glad and happy to fetch his little sweetheart. So when he got to Doll i' the Grass, he wished to take her up before him on his horse; but she wouldn't have that, for she said she would sit and drive along in a silver spoon, and that she had two small white horses to draw her. So off they set, he on his horse and she on her silver spoon, and the two horses that drew her were two tiny white mice. But Boots always kept the other side of the road, he was so afraid lest he should ride over her, she was so little.
So when they had gone a bit of the way, they came to a great piece of water. Here Boots' horse got frightened, and shied across the road and upset the spoon, and Doll i' the Grass tumbled into the water. Then Boots got so sorrowful, because he didn't know how to get her out again. But in a little while up came a merman with her, and now she was as well and full grown as other men and women, and far lovelier than she had been before. So he took her up before him on his horse, and rode home.
When Boots got home all his brothers had come back, each with his sweetheart, but these were all so ugly, and foul, and wicked, that they had done nothing but fight with one another on the way home, and on their heads they had a kind of hat that was daubed over with tar and soot, and so the rain had run down off the hats onto their faces, till they got far uglier and nastier than they had been before.
When his brothers saw Boots and his sweetheart, they were all as jealous as jealous could be of her; but the king was so overjoyed with them both, that he drove all the others away, and so boots held his wedding feat with Doll i' the Grass, and after that they lived well and happily together a long, long time, and if they're not dead, why they're alive still.

One fine day in winter some ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got rather damp during a long spell of rain. Presently up came a grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains, "For," she said, "I'm simply starving."
The ants stopped work for a moment, though this was against their principles. "May we ask," said they, "what you were doing with yourself all last summer? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?"
"The fact is," replied the grasshopper, "I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time."
"If you spent the summer singing," replied the ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing."
And they chuckled and went on with their work.

A man had a donkey, who for long years had untiringly carried sacks to the mill, but whose strength was now failing, so that he was becoming less and less able to work. Then his master thought that he would no longer feed him, but the donkey noticed that it was not a good wind that was blowing and ran away, setting forth on the road to Bremen, where he thought he could become a town musician. When he had gone a little way he found a hunting dog lying in the road, who was panting like one who had run himself tired.
"Why are you panting so, Grab-Hold?" asked the donkey.
"Oh," said the dog, "because I am old and am getting weaker every day and can no longer go hunting, my master wanted to kill me, so I ran off; but now how should I earn my bread?"
"Do you know what," said the donkey, "I am going to Bremen and am going to become a town musician there. Come along and take up music too. I'll play the lute, and you can beat the drums."
The dog was satisfied with that, and they went further. It didn't take long, before they came to a cat sitting by the side of the road and making a face like three days of rainy weather. "What has crossed you, old Beard-Licker?" said the donkey.
"Oh," answered the cat, "who can be cheerful when his neck is at risk? I am getting on in years, and my teeth are getting dull, so I would rather sit behind the stove and purr than to chase around after mice. Therefore my mistress wanted to drown me, but I took off. Now good advice is scarce. Where should I go?"
"Come with us to Bremen. After all, you understand night music. You can become a town musician there." The cat agreed and went along.
Then the three refugees came to a farmyard, and the rooster of the house was sitting on the gate crying with all his might.
"Your cries pierce one's marrow and bone," said the donkey. "What are you up to?"
"I just prophesied good weather," said the rooster, "because it is Our Dear Lady's Day, when she washes the Christ Child's shirts and wants to dry them; but because Sunday guests are coming tomorrow, the lady of the house has no mercy and told the cook that she wants to eat me tomorrow in the soup, so I am supposed to let them cut off my head this evening. Now I am going to cry at the top of my voice as long as I can."
"Hey now, Red-Head," said the donkey, "instead come away with us. We're going to Bremen. You can always find something better than death. You have a good voice, and when we make music together, it will be very pleasing."
The rooster was happy with the proposal, and all four went off together. However, they could not reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came into a forest, where they would spend the night. The donkey and the dog lay down under a big tree, but the cat and the rooster took to the branches. The rooster flew right to the top, where it was safest for him. Before falling asleep he looked around once again in all four directions, and he thought that he saw a little spark burning in the distance. He hollered to his companions, that there must be a house not too far away, for a light was shining.
The donkey said, "Then we must get up and go there, because the lodging here is poor." The dog said that he could do well with a few bones with a little meat on them. Thus they set forth toward the place where the light was, and they soon saw it glistening more brightly, and it became larger and larger, until they came to the front of a brightly lit robbers' house.
The donkey, the largest of them, approached the window and looked in.
"What do you see, Gray-Horse?" asked the rooster.
"What do I see?" answered the donkey. "A table set with good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting there enjoying themselves."
"That would be something for us," said the rooster.
"Ee-ah, ee-ah, oh, if we were there!" said the donkey.
Then the animals discussed how they might drive the robbers away, and at last they came upon a plan. The donkey was to stand with his front feet on the window, the dog to jump on the donkey's back, the cat to climb onto the dog, and finally the rooster would fly up and sit on the cat's head. When they had done that, at a signal they began to make their music all together. The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat meowed and the rooster crowed. Then they crashed through the window into the room, shattering the panes.
The robbers jumped up at the terrible bellowing, thinking that a ghost was coming in, and fled in great fear out into the woods. Then the four companions seated themselves at the table and freely partook of the leftovers, eating as if they would get nothing more for four weeks.
When the four minstrels were finished, they put out the light and looked for a place to sleep, each according to his nature and his desire. The donkey lay down on the manure pile, the dog behind the door, the cat on the hearth next to the warm ashes, and the rooster sat on the beam of the roof. Because they were tired from their long journey, they soon fell asleep.
When midnight had passed and the robbers saw from the distance that the light was no longer burning in the house, and everything appeared to be quiet, the captain said, "We shouldn't have let ourselves be chased off," and he told one of them to go back and investigate the house. The one they sent found everything still, and went into the kitchen to strike a light. He mistook the cat's glowing, fiery eyes for live coals, and held a sulfur match next to them, so that it would catch fire. But the cat didn't think this was funny and jumped into his face, spitting, and scratching.
He was terribly frightened and ran toward the back door, but the dog, who was lying there, jumped up and bit him in the leg. When he ran across the yard past the manure pile, the donkey gave him a healthy blow with his hind foot, and the rooster, who had been awakened from his sleep by the noise and was now alert, cried down from the beam, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
Then the robber ran as fast as he could back to his captain and said, "Oh, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, she blew at me and scratched my face with her long fingers. And there is a man with a knife standing in front of the door, and he stabbed me in the leg. And a black monster is lying in the yard, and it struck at me with a wooden club. And the judge is sitting up there on the roof, and he was calling out, 'Bring the rascal here.' Then I did what I could to get away."
From that time forth, the robbers did not dare go back into the house. However, the four Bremen Musicians liked it so well there, that they never left it again. And the person who just told that, his mouth is still warm.

Once upon a time there was a miller's servant who had served his master faithfully and diligently for many years. He had grown old in the mill, and the heavy work that he had to do there finally surpassed his strength. So one day he said to his master: "I can no longer serve you; I am too weak. I am therefore asking you for my dismissal and my wages."
The miller said: "The time of wandering servants has passed. You are free to leave if you wish, but you will receive no wages.
Now the old servant would sooner give up his wages than to continue to be tormented in the mill, so he took leave from his master.
Before leaving home he went to the animals that until now he had fed and tended, in order to bid them farewell. While taking leave from the horse, it said to him: "Where are you going?"
"I have to leave," he said. "I cannot take it here any longer." And when he set forth, the horse followed along after him.
He then went to the ox, stroked him once again, and said: "God be with you, old fellow!"
"Where are you going?" spoke the ox.
"Oh, I must leave. I cannot take it here any longer," said the miller's servant and sadly went on his way to take leave from the dog. The ox followed along behind, just as the horse had done. And the other animals to whom he said farewell -- the dog, the cat, the goose, and the rooster -- all did the same thing.
He made his way out into the country, where he first noticed that the faithful animals were following him. He spoke to them in a friendly manner, asking them to turn around and return home. "I have nothing more for myself," he said, "and I can no longer care for you." But the animals told him that they would not abandon him, and they contentedly followed along behind.
After several days they came to a great forest. Here the horse and the ox found good grass, which the goose and the rooster enjoyed as well. However, the other animals -- the cat and the dog -- had to suffer hunger, as did the old miller's servant; but they did not grumble and complain. Finally, after having gone very deep into the forest, they suddenly saw a large, beautiful house before them. It was locked up securely. Only an empty stall was open, and from here they could go through the barn into the house itself.
Because no one could be seen in the house, the servant decided to stay there with his animals, and he assigned each one to a place. He put the horse up front in the stall. He led the ox to the other side. The rooster was given a place on the roof, the dog on the manure pile, the cat on the hearth, and the goose behind the stove. Then he gave each one his feed, which was plentifully stored in the house. He himself ate and drank all he wanted, then fell asleep in a good bed, which was all made up in the bedroom.
During the night, while he was fast asleep, the robber -- who owned the forest house -- returned. As he stepped into yard, the dog jumped on him furiously, and barked at him. The rooster cried down from the roof: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-doo!" All this terrified the robber, for he had never seen farm animals that live with people, knowing instead only the wild animals of the forest. He fled hurriedly into the stall, but there the horse kicked out from behind, hitting him in the side. He staggered around and around, and only with difficulty could he retreat into the back part of the stall. He scarcely arrived there when the ox turned around and tried to pick him up on his horns. This frightened him anew, and he ran as fast as he could through the barn and into the kitchen, where he wanted to strike a light and see what was there. Feeling around the hearth, he touched the cat, which jumped on him and scratched him with its claws until jumped away head over heels, and tried to hide behind the stove in the main room. The goose jumped up, screaming and beating its wings. The terrified robber fled into the bedroom. There the miller's servant was snoring mightily like a purring spinning wheel, and the robber thought the entire room was filled with strangers. You had better believe that he was overcome by a terrible fear. He rushed out of the house and ran into the woods, not stopping until until he had found his fellow robbers.
He began talking: "I don't know what has happened in our house. Some strange people are living there. When I stepped into the yard a large wildman jumped at me, yelling and bellowing so terribly that I thought he would kill me. An another one cheered him on, calling down from the roof: 'Hit him for me too! Hit him for me too!' The first one was bad enough; I wasn't going to wait for more of them to jump me, so I fled into the stall. There a shoemaker threw a last at my side, and I can still feel where it hit. I ran to the back of the stall. A pitchfork maker was standing there who tried to impale me on his pitchfork. I ran into the kitchen, where a hackle maker beat me with his hackle. I tried to hide behind the stove, but there was a shovel maker there who beat me with his shovel. Finally I ran into the bedroom, but there were so many others snoring in there that was happy to escape with my life."
When the robbers heard this, they were so horrified that not a one of them had any desire to enter the house. To the contrary, they believed that the entire region was threatened by these strange people. That same night they departed for another country, and they never returned.
The miller's servant lived in peace in the robbers' house with his faithful animals. He no longer had to suffer in his old age, for the beautiful garden next to the house produced more fruit, vegetables, and all kinds of food every year than he and his animals could eat.


Once on a time there was a sheep who stood in the pen to be fattened; so he lived well, and was stuffed and crammed with everything that was good.
So it went on, till, one day, the dairymaid came and gave him still more food, and then she said, "Eat. away, sheep; you won't be much longer here; we are going to kill you tomorrow."
It is an old saying, that women's counsel is always worth having, and that there is a cure and physic for everything but death.
"But, after all," said the sheep to himself, "there may be a cure even for death this time."
So he ate till he was ready to burst; and when he was crammed full, he butted out the door of the pen, and took his way to the neighboring farm. There he went to the pigsty to a pig whom he had known out on the common, and ever since had been the best friends with.
"Good day!" said the sheep, "and thanks for our last merry meeting."
"Good day!" answered the pig, "and the same to you."
"Do you know," said the sheep, "why it is you are so well off, and why it is they fatten you and take such pains with you?"
"No, I don't," said the pig.
"Many a flask empties the cask; I suppose you know that," said the sheep. "They are going to kill and eat you."
"Are they?" said the pig. "Well, I hope they'll say grace after meat."
"If you will do as I do," said the sheep, "we'll go off to the wood, build us a house, and set up for ourselves. A home is a home be it ever so homely."
Yes! The pig was willing enough.
"Good company is such a comfort," he said, and so the two set off.
So, when they had gone a bit they met a goose.
"Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting," said the goose. "Whither away so fast today?"
"Good day, and the same to you," said the sheep. "You must know we were too well off at home, and so we are going to set up for ourselves in the wood, for you know every man's house is his castle."
"Well!" said the goose, "it's much the same with me where I am. Can't I go with you too, for it's child's play when three share the day."
"With gossip and gabble is built neither house nor stable," said the pig. "Let us know what you can do."
"By cunning and skill a cripple can do what he will," said the goose. "I can pluck moss and stuff it into the seams of the planks, and your house will be tight and warm."
"Yes! They would give him leave, for above all things, piggy wished to be warm and comfortable.
So, when they had gone a bit farther -- the goose had hard work to walk so fast -- they met a hare, who came frisking out of the wood.
"Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting," she said. "How far are you trotting today?"
"Good day, and the same to you," said the sheep. "We were far too well off at home, and so we're going to the wood, to build us a house, and set up for ourselves, for you know, try all the world round, there's nothing like home."
"As for that," said the hare, "I have a house in every bush -- yes, a house in every bush; but, yet, I have often said, in winter, 'If I only live till summer, I'll build me a house.' And so I have half a mind to go with you and build one up, after all."
"Yes!" said the pig. "If we ever get into a scrape, we might use you to scare away the dogs, for you don't fancy you could help us in house building."
"He who lives long enough always finds work enough to do," said the hare. "I have teeth to gnaw pegs, and paws to drive them into the wall, so I can very well set up to be a carpenter, for 'good tools make good work,' as the man said, when he flayed the mare with a gimlet."
Yes! He too got leave to go with them and build their house; there was nothing more to be said about it.
When they had gone a bit farther they met a cock.
"Good day, good sirs," said the cock, "and thanks for our last merry meeting. Whither are ye going today, gentlemen?"
"Good day, and the same to you," said the sheep. "At home we were too well off, and so we are going off to the wood to build us a house, and set up for ourselves; for he who out of doors shall bake, loses at last both coal and cake."
"Well! said the cock, "that's just my case; but it's better to sit on one's own perch, for then one can never be left in the lurch, and, besides, all cocks crow loudest at home. Now, if I might have leave to join such a gallant company, I also would like to go to the wood and build a house."
"Ay! Ay!" said the pig. "Flapping and crowing sets tongues a-going; but a jaw on a stick never yet laid a brick. How can you ever help us to build a house?"
"Oh!" said the cock, "that house will never have a clock, where there is neither dog nor cock. I am up early, and I wake every one."
"Very true," said the pig. "The morning hour has a golden dower; let him come with us;" for, you must know, piggy was always the soundest sleeper. "Sleep is the biggest thief," he said. "He thinks nothing of stealing half one's life."
So they all set off to the wood, as a band and brotherhood, and built the house. The pig hewed the timber, and the sheep drew it home; the hare was carpenter, and gnawed pegs and bolts, and hammered them into the walls and roof; the goose plucked moss and stuffed it into the seams; the cock crew, and looked out that they did not oversleep themselves in the morning; and when the house was ready, and the roof lined with birch bark, and thatched with turf. There they lived by themselves, and were merry and well.
"Tis good to travel east and west," said the sheep, "but after all a home is best."
But you must know that a bit farther on in the wood was a wolf's den, and there lived two graylegs. So when they saw that a new house had risen up hard by, they wanted to know what sort of folk their neighbors were, for they thought to themselves that a good neighbor was better than a brother in a foreign land, and that it was better to live in a good neighborhood than to know many people miles and miles off.
So one of them made up an errand, and went into the new house and asked for a light for his pipe. But as soon as ever he got inside the door, the sheep gave him such a butt that he fell head foremost into the stove. Then the pig began to gore and bite him, the goose to nip and peck him, the cock upon the roost to crow and chatter; and as for the hare -- he was so frightened out of his wits, that he ran about aloft and on the floor, and scratched and scrambled in every corner of the house.
So after a long time the wolf came out.
"Well!" said the one who waited for him outside, "neighborhood makes brotherhood. You must have come into a perfect paradise on bare earth, since you stayed so long. But what became of the light, for you have neither pipe nor smoke."
"Yes, yes!" said the other. "It was just a nice light and a pleasant company. Such manners I never saw in all my life. But then you know we can't pick and choose in this wicked world, and an unbidden guest gets bad treatment. As soon as I got inside the door, the shoemaker let fly at me with his last, so that I fell head foremost into the stithy fire; and there sat two smiths who blew the bellows and made the sparks fly, and beat and punched me with red hot tongs and pincers, so that they tore whole pieces out of my body. As for the hunter he went scrambling about looking for his gun, and it was good luck he did not find it. And all the while there was another who sat up under the roof, and slapped his arms and sang out, 'Put a hook into him and drag him hither; drag him hither.' That was what he screamed, and if he had only got hold of me, I should never have come out alive."


A bull, a tup , a cock, and a steg  set out together to seek their fortune. When it got to night, they came to a house, and asked for a night's lodging, but the folks said no. However, at last they were let come into the kitchen. The bull said he would lie on the floor, the tup said he would lie by his side, the cock would perch on the rannel bank, and the steg would stand at t' back of the door.
At midnight, when all was quiet, two men, meaning to rob the house, were heard parleying outside which should go in, and which watch outside. One went in, the bull got up and knocked him about, the tup did the same, and the cock said, "Fetch him here, I'll pick out his eyen."
So he says, "I'd best be out of this."
As he went to the door, the steg took him by the nose with its neb, and beat him with its wings.
The other said when he got out, "What have you done?"
"Done!" says he, "The devil knocked me about; when he'd done, one of his imps set on. A thin wi' glowering eyen said, 'Fetch him here,' etc. and when I got to the door, a blacksmith took me by the snout with his tongs, and flapped me by the lugs with his leather apron."


The miller of Sandhills had a donkey which had served him well in its time, but was now too old to work. The miller was a careful man, who did not believe in feeding useless mouths, so he decided that he would sell the donkey for the price of its skin.
"I do not suppose I shall get very much for the wretched beast," he said, regarding poor Grayskin as he stood with hanging head in his stall, "but I shall save the cost of his corn anyhow, and that is always something."
Left alone, Grayskin reflected sadly upon the fate in store for him. "Such is the way of the world," he thought. "When I was young and hearty nothing was too good for me. Now I'm old and useless I am to be cast out. But am I so useless after all? True, I can no longer pull a cart to market, but I have a magnificent voice still. There must be a place somewhere for one who can sing as beautifully as I. I'll go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule in Brussels and offer myself as a chorister."
Grayskin lost no time in acting upon his resolve, but left his stable immediately and set out on the road to Brussels. Passing the burgomaster's house he saw an old hound sitting disconsolately on the doorstep.
"Hallo, friend!" said he. "What is the matter with you? You seem very sad this morning."
"The matter is that I am tired of life," answered the dog. "I'm getting old and stiff, and I can no longer hunt hares for my master as I used to do. The result is that I am reckoned good for nothing, and they grudge me every morsel of food I put into my mouth."
"Come, come, cheer up, my friend," said Grayskin. "Never say die! I am in a similar case to yourself and have just left my master for precisely the same reason. My plan is to go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule and offer my services to the master of the choir. If I may say so without conceit, I have a lovely voice -- one must make the most of one's gifts, you know -- and I ought to be able to command good pay."
"Well, if it comes to that," said the dog, "I can sing too. I sang a lovely song to the moon last night, and if you'll believe me, all the people in our street opened their windows to listen. I sang for quite an hour, and I'd have gone on longer if some malicious person, who was no doubt jealous, had not thrown an old boot at my head."
"Excellent," said Grayskin. "Come along with me. You shall sing tenor and I'll sing bass. We'll make a famous pair."
So the dog joined company with Grayskin, and they went on together towards Brussels.
A little farther down the road they saw a cat sitting on the rubbish heap outside a miserable hovel. The creature was half blind with age and had a face as long as a fiddle.
"Why, what is the matter with you?" asked Grayskin, who had a tender heart.
"Matter enough," said the cat. "I've just been turned out of house and home, and all because I took a little piece of bacon from the larder. Upon my honor, it was no bigger than a baby's fist, but they made as much fuss as though it had been a whole gammon. I was beaten and kicked out to starve. If I could catch mice as I used to do, it would not matter so much, but the mice are too quick for me nowadays. They laugh at me. Nothing remains for me but to die, and I hope it may be soon."
"Nonsense," said Grayskin. "You shall live to laugh at all your troubles. Come along with us and sing in the choir at St. Gudule. Your voice is a little too thin for my own taste, but you'll make a very good soprano in a trio. What do you say?"
"You give me new hopes," answered the cat. "Of course I'll join you," and so the three went on together.
Towards nightfall they arrived at a farmyard, on the gate of which a cock was crowing lustily.
"Hall!" said Grayskin. "What's all this about?"
"I am singing my last song on earth," said the cock. "An hour ago I sang a song, although it is not my usual custom to crow in the afternoon, and as I ended I heard the farmer's wife say, 'Hearken to Chanticleer. He's crowing for fine weather tomorrow. I wonder if he'd crow so loudly if he knew that we had guests coming, and that he was going into the pot to make their soup!' She has a horrid laugh, that woman. I have always hated her!"
"And do you mean to tell me," said Grayskin, "that you are going to stay here quite contentedly till they come to wring your neck?"
"What else can I do?" asked Chanticleer.
"Join us and turn your talents to account. We are all beautiful singers and we are going to Brussels to offer ourselves as choristers at St. Gudule. We were a trio before. With you we shall be a quartet, and that's one better!"
Chanticleer was only too glad to find a means of escape, so he willingly joined the party, and they once more took the road.
A little while afterwards they came to a thick wood, which was the haunt of a notorious band of robbers. There they decided to rest for the night, so Grayskin and the dog lay down beneath the shelter of a large beech tree, while the cat climbed onto one of the branches, and Chanticleer perched himself at the very top. From this lofty post he could see over the whole wood, and it was not long before he espied a light twinkling among the trees not far away.
"There must be a house of some sort over there," he said to his companions. "Shall we go and see? We may find something to eat."
"Or some straw to lie upon, at any rate," said Grayskin. "This damp ground gives me rheumatics in my old bones."
"I was just thinking the same thing," said the dog. "Let us go."
So the four choristers, led by the cock, walked in the direction from which the light came, and before long they found themselves in front of a little house, the windows of which were brilliantly lighted. In order to reach to the windows the animals made a tower of their bodies, with Grayskin at the bottom and Chanticleer at the top.
Now this house was the abode of a band of robbers, who, at that very moment, were seated before a table laden with all kinds of food. There they sat and feasted, and poor Chanticleer's mouth watered as he watched them.
"Is there anybody inside?" asked the dog, who was impatient.
"Hush!" said Chanticleer. "Men! They're eating their dinner!"
"I wish I was," said the dog. "What are they eating?"
"All sorts of things -- sausage and fish ...."
"Sausage!" said the dog.
"Fish!" said the cat.
"And ever so many other delicacies," Chanticleer went on. "Look here, friends. Wouldn't it be a fine thing if we could get a share of their meal? I confess that my stomach aches with hunger."
"And mine too," said the dog. "I've never been so hungry in my life. But how are we to get the food?"
"Let us serenade them, and perhaps they'll throw us something as a reward," said Grayskin. "Music, you know, has charms to soothe the savage breast."
This seemed such a good idea that the choristers lost no time in putting it into execution. All four began to sing. They donkey hee-hawed, the dog howled, the cat meowed, and the cock crowed. From the noise they made one would have thought that the heavens were falling.
The effect of this marvelous quartet upon the robbers was instantaneous. Leaping from their seats, they ran from place to place in mortal terror, tumbling over one another, oversetting chairs and adding to the racket by their shrieks and cries. At that moment the cock fell against the window, breaking the glass to smithereens. The donkey gave the frame a push, and all the four precipitated themselves into the room.
This was the last straw. The robbers could stand no more. Half mad with fear they rushed to the door and fled into the forest.
Then our four choristers drew up to the table and set to work upon the food with which it was laden. Their long walk had given them a good appetite, so that there was little left by the time they had finished. Feeling drowsy after their meal, they then settled themselves to sleep. The donkey made himself a bed on a heap of straw in the yard; the dog stretched himself out upon the mat by the house door; the cat lay among the warm cinders on the hearth; and the cock perched upon the rooftop. A few minutes more and they were all fast asleep.
Meanwhile the robbers, who had retreated some distance into the forest, waited anxiously for something dreadful to happen. An hour passed by and there was neither sight nor sound to alarm them, so they began to feel a little ashamed of their cowardice. Creeping stealthily nearer to the cottage, they saw that everything was still, and that no light was showing from the windows.
At last the robber chief sent his lieutenant to spy out the land, and this man, returning to the cottage without mishap, found his way into the kitchen and proceeded to light a candle. He had no matches, but he saw two sparks of fire among the cinders on the hearth, so he went forward to get a light from them.
Now this light came from the cat's eyes, and as soon as puss felt the robber touch her, she sprang up, snarling and spitting, and scratched his face. With a scream of terror, he dropped his candle and rushed for the door, and as he passed, the dog bit him in the leg. By this time the noise had awakened Grayskin, who got upon his feet just as the man ran by, and helped him forward with a might kick, which sent him flying out into the roadway. Seeing this, the cock on the housetop spread his wings and crowed in triumph, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
I wish you could have seen the way that robber ran! He covered the ground so quickly that he seemed like a flying shadow, and I am perfectly certain that not even a hare could have overtaken him. At last, panting for breath, he rejoined his comrades in the forest, who were eagerly awaiting his return.
"Well," cried the chief, "is the way clear? Can we go back?"
"Not on any account," cried the robber. "There's a horrible witch in the kitchen. Directly I entered she sprang at me and tore my face with her long claws, calling out at the same time to her creatures to come and devour me. As I ran through the door, one of them buried his fangs in my leg, and a little farther on, in the yard, a great black monster struck at me with an enormous club, giving me a blow that nearly broke my backbone. On the roof a little demon with wings and eyes that shone like coals of fire cried, 'Stop him! Eat him! Stop him! Eat him!' You may guess that I did not wait for more. It is a miracle that I have escaped with my life!"
When they heard this terrible story the robbers lost no time in decamping, and such was their terror that they deserted the forest altogether and went away to another part of the country. The result was that our four friends were left to dwell in the cottage, where they lived happily for the rest of their lives, and as they had now everything they wanted, they quite gave up their idea of going to St. Gudule.


A lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health, with the exception of the fox. The wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the fox, so he called the attention of the lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."
Just then the fox came in and heard the last words of the wolf. The lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."
"And may I ask if you have found one?" said the lion.
"I have, sire," said the fox, "and it is this: You must flay a wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."
The lion accordingly turned to the wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the fox's prescription. But the fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comes of stirring ill-will."

The fox is much troubled by fleas, and this is the way in which he gets rid of them. He hunts about until he finds a lock of wool, and then he takes it to the river, and holds it in his mouth, and so puts the end of his brush into the water, and down he goes slowly. The fleas run away from the water, and at last they all run over the fox's nose into the wool, and then the fox dips his nose under and lets the wool go off with the stream.
A bear and a fox had once bought between them a tub of butter, which they intended to keep till Christmas, and, therefore, hid it under a thick pine bush. They then went a little distance and lay down on a sunny bank to sleep.
When they had lain some time, the fox started up and cried out, "Yes," and ran away towards the butter tub, out of which he ate a good third. When he returned the bear asked him where he had been, as he looked so greasy about the mouth.
He said, "What do you think of my being invited to a christening?"
"Oh, indeed! What is the name of the child?" asked the bear.
"Begun Upon," answered the fox.
Thereupon they lay down to sleep again. In a little while the fox sprang up again and cried out, "Yes," and ran to the butter tub. This time he also ate a good portion. When he came back, and the bear again asked where he had been, he answered, "Oh, would you believe it? I have again been invited to a christening."
"What is the name of the child?" asked the bear.
"Half Eaten," answered the fox.
The bear thought that was a strange name, though he did not wonder long about it, but gave a gape and went to sleep again. They had not lain long when the same took place as before. The fox sprang up and cried out, "Yes," and ran to the butter tub, and this time he ate the remainder. When he came back, he had been once more to a christening, and when the bear inquired the name of the child, he answered, "Licked to the Bottom!"
They now lay down and slept a long time.
At length they agreed to go and look after their butter, and when they found it all eaten up, the bear accused the fox, and the fox accused the bear, of having eaten it. One said that the other must have been to the butter tub while he slept.
"Well, well!" said Reynard. "We shall soon see which of us two has stolen the butter. Let us both now lie down on this sunny bank, and the one whose tail is the greasiest when we wake, must be the one who has stolen it."
The bear was willing to undergo the ordeal. So, feeling conscious of his innocence, and that he had not even tasted the butter, he lay down to have a good sound sleep in the sun. But Reynard, instead of sleeping, crept softly to the butter tub, and got a little that still remained between the staves. Then sneaking gently back to the bear, he rubbed his tail with it, and lay down to sleep as if nothing had happened. When they both woke, the sun had melted the butter on the bear's tail, so that he was proved to be the one that had eaten the butter.

The fox and the wolf stole a keg of butter from a peasant and hid it in a safe place. However, the hiding-place was far from where they lived, and one day when the fox got the urge to have a taste of the butter by himself, he felt the necessity of borrowing the wolf's boots for the long journey. The wolf, of course, asked him why he needed the boots.
"Well," said the fox, "I must travel a great distance to a baptism."
"Good," said the wolf, and the fox, wearing the wolf's boots, took off for the keg.
When he returned, the wolf asked him what the child's name was.
"Beginning" said the fox, and wolf thought to himself, "That is a nice name."
A short time later the fox came again and asked to borrow the boots, saying that once again he had to go to a baptism.
"Good," said the wolf, and once again the fox set forth wearing the wolf's boots.
When he returned, the wolf asked him, "What is the child's name?"
"Middle-of-the-Keg" said the fox, and the wolf thought, "That is an even nicer name."
Some time later the fox came again and said that still another child was to be baptized. When he brought back the boots, the wolf again asked him what name the child had been given.
"Well," said the fox, "this time his name is Bottom-of-the-Keg."
When the fox came a fourth time, the wolf grew somewhat impatient and asked if there would be no end to the baptisms.
"Yes," said the fox. "This is the last time."
"If that is so," said the wolf, "then go ahead and put on the boots."
The fox went again to the keg, and licked it clean. Then he filled it with stones, spread a thin layer of butter over them, and went home.
The wolf again asked him what the child's name was, and the fox answered, "Scrape-out-the-Keg."
Some time later the fox proposed to the wolf that the two of them should go to the keg of butter and have a real feast. Arriving there, they began quarreling with one another which one should have the first serving. Unable to decide, they drew straws. The wolf was lucky and drew the longer one, so he was to begin first. He started eating vigorously, but, of course, got only a mouthful of stones.
You should have seen the wolf and the fox. Each one accused the other one of eating up the butter.
"You did it when you were going to the baptisms," said the wolf.
"No," said the fox. "You did it when you knew that I wasn't at home."
But none of this led anywhere. The keg was empty and remained empty, so they decided to return home without further delay.
On their way home they found an old horse in a mire. They wanted to take it with them and asked one another how they might manage.
The fox said, "You are the strongest. Tie the horse's tail around your body and pull, while I prod the horse with a stick."
That happened, and soon the horse was out of the mud, but it then ran off with the wolf tied to its tail.
"Claw your paws into the ground!" cried the fox.
"But I can see neither heaven nor earth!" answered the wolf.
Finally the wolf succeeded in breaking loose, and he and the fox continued on their way, but without the horse.
When they arrived at home the wolf sat down with his back to the fire, for he was wet to the bone. Sitting there, he fell asleep. The fox took some butter and spread it under the wolf's tail. Because of the warmth it soon melted.
Then the fox woke up the wolf and shouted, "Now it is clear who licked out the butter keg."

The russet dog and the wild dog (the fox and the wolf) were going together. And they went round about the seashore, and they found a keg of butter, and they buried it.
On the morrow the fox went out, and when he returned, he said that a man had come to ask him to a baptism. The fox went, and he arrayed himself in excellent attire, and he went away. And where should he go but to the butter keg. And when he came home, the wolf asked him, "What name was given to the child?"
And he said that it was Foveeal (under its mouth).
On the morrow the fox said that a man had sent to ask him to a baptism. And he went to the keg, and he took out about half.
The wolf asked, when he came home, "What name was given to the child?"
"Well," said he, "It is a queer name that I myself would not give to my man child, if I had one. It is Moolay Moolay (about half and half)."
On the morrow the fox said that a man had come to ask him to a baptism again. And he went to the keg, and he ate it all up. When he came home, the wolf asked him, "What name was given to the child?"
And he said that it was Booill Eemlich (licking all up).
On the morrow the fox said to the wolf that they ought to bring the keg home. They went, and when they reached the keg, there was not a shadow of the butter in it.
"Well," said the fox, "you came here without me!"
The other one swore that he had not come near it.
"You need not be claiming that you did not come here. I know that you did come, and that it was you who took the butter. And when we go home, I will see if you ate the butter," said the fox.
When they arrived home, the fox hung the wolf by his hind legs, with his head dangling below him. Then he put a dab of the butter under the wolf's mouth, as though it had come out of the wolf's belly.
"You red thief!" said the fox. "I said before, that it was you who ate the butter!"

A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her, that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. "But we must make preparations for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger," said the cat, "and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere, or in the end you will be caught in a trap."
This good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat, but they did not know where to store it. Finally, after much consideration, the cat said, "I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church. No one dares take anything away from there. We will put it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are need it."
So the pot was stored safely away, but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, "I wanted to tell you, little mouse, that my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and she has asked me to be his godfather. He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself."
"Yes, yes," answered the mouse. "By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me. I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself."
All this, however, was untrue. The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather. He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat. Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun, licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat. He did not return home until it was evening.
"Well, here you are again," said the mouse. "You must have had a happy day."
"Everything went well," answered the cat.
"What name did they give the child?" asked the mouse.
"Top-Off," said the cat quite coolly.
"Top-Off?" cried the mouse. "That is a very odd and uncommon name. Is it a usual one in your family?"
"What does that matter?", said the cat. "It is no worse than Crumb-Thief, as your godchildren are called."
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. He said to the mouse, "You must do me a favor, and once more manage the house alone for a day. I have been asked again to be godfather, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse."
The good mouse consented. However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. "Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself," he said, and was quite satisfied with his day's work.
When he arrived home the mouse asked, "What name was this child christened with?"
"Half-Gone," answered the cat.
"Half-Gone? What are you saying? I have never heard that name in all my life. I'll wager it is not in the almanac."
The cat's mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods. "All good things come in threes," he said to the mouse. "I have been asked to be godfather again. The child is totally black, only it has white paws. Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body. This only happens once every few years. You will let me go, won't you?"
"Top-Off. Half-Gone," answered the mouse. "They are such odd names, that they make me stop and think."
"Here you sit at home," said the cat, "with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies. That is because you do not go out in the daytime."
During the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat. "One has peace only after everything is eaten up," he said to himself. Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime.
The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child.
"You will not like it either," said the cat. "His name is All-Gone."
"All-Gone!", cried the mouse. "That is the most worrisome name of all. I have never seen it in print. All-Gone! What can that mean?" Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.
From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather, but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their stored food, and said, "Come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves. It will taste good now."
"Yes," answered the cat. "You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."
They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat, to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty. "Alas," said the mouse, "now I see what has happened. Now it comes to light. You are a true friend. You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather. First top off, then half done, then ..."
"Be quiet!" cried the cat. "One more word, and I will eat you too."
"All gone" was already on the poor mouse's lips. She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. You see, that is the way of the world.

One fine evening a young princess went into a wood, and sat down by the side of a cool spring of water. She had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favorite plaything, and she amused herself with tossing it into the air and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that when she stretched out her hand to catch it, the ball bounded away and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball; but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it.
Then she began to lament her loss, and said, "Alas! If I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world."
Whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and said, "Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?"
"Alas! said she, "What can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring."
The frog said, "I want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothes; but if you will love me and let me live with you, and eat from your little golden plate, and sleep upon your little bed, I will bring you your ball again."
"What nonsense," thought the princess, "This silly frog is talking! He can never get out of the well. However, he may be able to get my ball for me; and therefore I will promise him what he asks." So she said to the frog, "Well, if you will bring me my ball, I promise to do all you require."
Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the ground. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up, and was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, "Stay, princess, and take me with you as you promised." But she did not stop to hear a word.
The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise, tap-tap, as if somebody was coming up the marble staircase. And soon afterwards something knocked gently at the door, and said,
Open the door, my princess dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.
Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. She was terribly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could, came back to her seat. The king, her father, asked her what had frightened her.
"There is a nasty frog," said she, "at the door, who lifted my ball out of the spring this morning. I promised him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door and wants to come in!"
While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said,
Open the door, my princess dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.
The king said to the young princess, "As you have made a promise, you must keep it. So go and let him in."
She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and came up close to the table. "Pray lift me upon a chair," said he to the princess, "and let me sit next to you." As soon as she had done this, the frog said, "Put your plate closer to me that I may eat out of it." This she did. And when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, "Now I am tired. Carry me upstairs and put me into your little bed."
And the princess took him up in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own little bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
"Now," thought the princess, "he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more."
But she was mistaken; for when night came again, she heard the same tapping at the door, and when she opened it, the frog came in and slept upon her pillow as before till the morning broke.
And the third night he did the same; but when the princess awoke on the following morning, she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes that ever were seen, and standing at the head of her bed.
He told her that he had been enchanted by a malicious fairy, who had changed him into the form of a frog, in which he was fated to remain till some princess should take him out of the spring and let him sleep upon her bed for three nights. "You," said the prince, "have broken this cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father's kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live."
The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in giving her consent; and as they spoke a splendid carriage drove up with eight beautiful horses decked with plumes of feathers and golden harness, and behind rode the prince's servant, the faithful Henry, who had bewailed the misfortune of his dear master so long and bitterly that his heart had well nigh burst. Then all set out full of joy for the prince's kingdom, where they arrived safely, and lived happily a great many years.

Once upon a time there was a merchant who had three daughters, but his wife was with God. Once he planned a journey across the ocean to a foreign land in order to bring back gold and other valuable things. He consoled his weeping children, saying, "I will bring back something beautiful for you. What do you want?"
The oldest asked for a silk dress, "and it must be made of three kinds of silk."
The second desired a feathered hat, "and it must have three kinds of feathers."
The youngest finally said, "Bring me a rose, dear father, and it must be fresh and have three colors."
The merchant promised to do this, kissed his daughters, and departed.
After arriving in the foreign land, he ordered the dress of three kinds of silk for his oldest daughter and the hat with three kinds of feathers for the second one. Both were soon finished, and of seldom splendor. Then he sent messengers throughout the entire country to seek a three-colored rose for his youngest and dearest daughter, but they all returned empty handed, even though the merchant had promised a high price, and even though there were more roses there than there are daisies here.
Sadly he set off for home and was downhearted the entire voyage. This side of the ocean he came to a large garden in which there was nothing but roses and roses. He went inside and looked, and behold, on a slender bush in the middle of the garden there was a three-colored rose. Filled with joy, he plucked it, and was about to leave, when he was magically frozen in place.
A voice behind him cried out, "What do you want in my garden?" He looked up. A large frog was sitting there on the bank of a clear pond staring at him with its goggle-eyes. It said, "You have broken my dear rose. This will cost you your life unless you give me your youngest daughter to wife."
The merchant was terrified. He begged and he pleaded, but all to no avail, and in the end he had to agree to marry his dearest daughter to the ugly frog. He could now move his feet, and he freely walked out of the garden. The frog called out after him, "In seven days I shall come for my wife!"
With great sorrow the merchant gave his youngest daughter the fresh rose and told her what had happened. When the terrible day arrived, she crept under her bed, for she did not at all want to go. At the hour of noon a stately carriage drove up. The frog sent his servants into the house, and they immediately went to the bedroom and dragged the screaming maiden from beneath her bed, then carried her to the carriage. The horses leaped forward, and a short time later they were in the blossoming rose garden. In the middle of the garden, immediately behind the clear pond, there stood a small house. They took the bride into the house and laid her on a soft bed. The frog, however, sprang into the water.
Darkness fell, and after the maiden had awakened from her unconsciousness, she heard the frog outside singing wonderfully sweet melodies. As midnight approached, he sang ever more sweetly, and came closer and closer to her. At midnight the bedroom door opened, and the frog jumped onto her bed. However, he had touched her with his sweet songs, and she took him into bed with her and warmly covered him up.
The next morning when she opened her eyes, behold, the ugly frog was now the handsomest prince in the world. He thanked her with all his heart, saying, "You have redeemed me and are now my wife!" And they lived long and happily together.


Many years ago there lived on the brow of a mountain, in the north of England, an old woman and her daughter. They were very poor, and obliged to work very hard for their living, and the old woman's temper was not very good, so that the maiden, who was very beautiful, led but an ill life with her.
The girl, indeed, was compelled to do the hardest work, for her mother got their principal means of subsistence by traveling to places in the neighborhood with small articles for sale, and when she came home in the afternoon she was not able to do much more work. Nearly the whole domestic labor of the cottage devolved therefore on the daughter, the most wearisome part of which consisted in the necessity of fetching all the water they required from a well on the other side of the hill, there being no river or spring near their own cottage.
It happened one morning that the daughter had the misfortune, in going to the well, to break the only pitcher they possessed, and having no other utensil she could use for the purpose, she was obliged to go home without bringing any water. When her mother returned, she was unfortunately troubled with excessive thirst, and the girl, though trembling for the consequences of her misfortune, told her exactly the circumstance that had occurred.
The old woman was furiously angry, and so far from making any allowances for her daughter, pointed to a sieve which happened to be on the table, and told her to go at once to the well and bring her some water in that, or never venture to appear again in her sight.
The young maiden, frightened almost out of her wits by her mother's fury, speedily took the sieve, and though she considered the task a hopeless one to accomplish, almost unconsciously hastened to the well. When she arrived there, beginning to reflect on the painful situation in which she was placed, and the utter impossibility of her obtaining a living by herself, she threw herself down on the brink of the well in an agony of despair.
Whilst she was in this condition, a large from came up to the top of the water, and asked her for what she was crying so bitterly. She was somewhat surprised at this, but not being the least frightened, told him the whole story, and that she was crying because she could not carry away water in the sieve.
"Is that all?" said the frog; "cheer up, my hinny! for if you will only let me sleep with you for two nights, and then chop off my head, I will tell you how to do it."
The maiden thought the frog could not be in earnest, but she was too impatient to consider much about it, and at once made the required promise. The frog then instructed her in the following words:
Stop with fog (moss),
And daub with clay;
And that will carry
The water away.
Having said this, he dived immediately under the water, and the girl, having followed his advice, got the sieve full of water, and returned home with it, not thinking much of her promise to the frog. By the time she reached home the old woman's wrath was appeased, but as they were eating their frugal supper very quietly, what should they hear but the splashing and croaking of a frog near the door, and shortly afterwards the daughter recognized the voice of the frog of the well saying:
Open the door, my hinny, my heart,
Open the door, my own darling;
Remember the word you spoke to me
In the meadow by the well-spring.
She was now dreadfully frightened, and hurriedly explained the matter to her mother, who was also so much alarmed at the circumstance, that she dared not refuse admittance to the frog, who, when the door was opened, leapt into the room, exclaiming:
Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,
Go wi' me to bed, my own darling;
Remember the words you spoke to me,
In the meadow by the well-spring.
This command was also obeyed, although as may be readily supposed, she did not much relish such a bedfellow. The next day, the frog was very quiet, and evidently enjoyed the fare they placed before him, the purest milk and the finest bread they could procure. In fact, neither the old woman nor her daughter spared any pains to render the frog comfortable. That night, immediately supper was finished, the frog again exclaimed:
Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,
Go wi' me to bed, my own darling;
Remember the words you spoke to me,
In the meadow by the well-spring.
She again allowed the frog to share her couch, and in the morning, as soon as she was dressed, he jumped towards her, saying:
Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,
Chop off my head, my own darling;
Remember the words you spoke to me,
In the meadow by the well-spring.
The maiden had no sooner accomplished this last request, than in the stead of the frog there stood by her side the handsomest prince in the world, who had long been transformed by a magician, and who could never have recovered his natural shape until a beautiful virgin had consented, of her own accord, to make him her bedfellow for two nights. the joy of all parties was complete; the girl and the prince were shortly afterwards married, and lived for many years in the enjoyment of every happiness.

As Chicken-Licken went one day to the wood, an acorn fell upon her poor bald pate, and she thought the sky had fallen. So she said she would go and tell the king that the sky had fallen. So Chicken-Licken turned back, and met Hen-Len.
"Well, Hen-Len, where are you going?"
And Hen-Len said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat."
And Chicken-Licken said, "Oh! Hen-Len, don't go, for I was going, and the sky fell upon my poor bald pate, and I'm going to tell the king."
So Hen-Len turned back with Chicken-Licken, and met Cock-Lock. "Oh! Cock-Lock, where are you going?"
And Cock-Lock said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat." Then Hen-Len said, "Oh! Cock-Lock, don't go, for I was going, and I met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Cock-Lock turned back, and met Duck-Luck. "Well, Duck-Luck, where are you going?"
And Duck-Luck said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat."
Then Cock-Lock said, "Oh! Duck-Luck, don't go, for I was going, and I met Hen-Len, and Hen-Len met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Duck-Luck turned back, and met Drake-Lake.
"Well, Drake-Lake, where are you going?" And Drake-Lake said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat."
Then Duck-Luck said, "Oh! Drake-Lake, don't go, for I was going, and I met Cock-Lock, and Cock-Lock met Hen-Len, and Hen-Len met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Drake-Lake turned back, and met Goose-Loose. "Well, Goose-Loose, where are you going?"
And Goose-Loose said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat."
Then Drake-Lake said, "Oh! Goose-Loose, don't go, for I was going, and I met Duck-Luck, and Duck-Luck met Cock-Lock, and Cock-Lock met Hen-Len, and Hen-Len met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Goose-Loose turned back, and met Gander-Lander. " Well, Gander-Lander, where are you going?"
And Gander-Lander said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat."
Then Goose-Loose said, "Oh! Gander-Lander, don't go, for I was going, and I met Drake-Lake, and Drake-Lake met Duck-Luck, and Duck-Luck met Cock-Lock, and Cock-Lock met Hen-Len, and Hen-Len met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Gander-Lander turned back, and met Turkey-Lurkey. "Well, Turkey-Lurkey, where are you going?"
And Turkey-Lurkey said, "I'm going to the wood for some meat." Then Gander-Lander said, "Oh! Turkey-Lurkey, don't go, for I was going, and I met Goose-Loose, and Goose-Loose met Drake-Lake, and Drake-Lake met Duck-Luck, and Duck-Luck met Cock-Lock, and Cock-Lock met Hen-Len, and Hen-Len met Chicken-Licken, and Chicken-Licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
So Turkey-Lurkey turned back, and walked with Gander-Lander, Goose-Loose, Drake-Lake, Duck-Luck, Cock-Lock, Hen-Len, and Chicken-Licken. And as they were going along, they met Fox-lox.
And Fox-Lox said, " Where are you going, my pretty maids?"
And they said, "Chicken-licken went to the wood, and the sky fell upon her poor bald pate, and we are going to tell the king."
And Fox-Lox said, "Come along with me, and I will show you the way."
But Fox-Lox took them into the fox's hole, and he and his young ones soon ate up poor Chicken-Licken, Hen-Len, Cock-Lock, Duck-Luck, Drake-Lake, Goose-Loose, Gander-Lander, and Turkey-Lurkey, and they never saw the king, to tell him that the sky had fallen!

Once upon a time there was a hen that had flown up and perched on an oak tree for the night. When the night came, she dreamed that unless she got to Dovrefjell, the world would come to an end. So that very minute she jumped down, and set out on her way. When she had walked a bit she met a cock.
"Good day, Cocky-Locky," said the hen.
"Good day, Henny-Penny," said the cock. "Where are you going so early?"
"Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end," said the hen.
"Who told you that, Henny-Penny?" asked the cock.
"I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night," said the hen.
"I'll go with you," said the cock.
Well, they walked on a good bit, and then they met a duck.
"Good day, Ducky-Lucky," said the cock.
"Good day, Cocky-Locky" said the duck. "Where are you going so early?"
"Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end," said the cock.
"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"
"Henny-Penny," said the cock.
"Who told you that, Henny-Penny?" asked the duck.
"I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night," said the hen.
"I'll go with you," said the duck.
So they went off together, and after a bit they met a goose.
"Good day, Goosey-Poosey," said the duck.
"Good day, Ducky-Lucky," said the goose. "Where are you going so early?"
"I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end," said the duck.
"Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?" asked the goose.
"Cocky-Locky."
"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"
"Henny-Penny."
"How do you know that, Henny-Penny?" said the goose.
"I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night, Goosey-Poosey," said the hen.
"I'll go with you," said the goose.
Now when they had all walked along for a bit, a fox met them.
"Good day, Foxy-Cocksy," said the goose.
"God day, Goosey-Poosey."
"Where are you going, Foxy-Cocksy?"
"Where are you going yourself, Goosey-Poosey?"
"I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end," said the goose.
"Who told you that, Goosey-Poosey?" asked the fox.
"Ducky-Lucky."
"Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"
"Cocky-Locky."
"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"
"Henny-Penny."
"How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"
"I sat in the oak and dreamed last night, that if we don't get to Dovrefjell, the world will come to an end," said the hen.
"Stuff and nonsense," said the fox. "The world won't come to an end if you don't go there. No, come home with me to my den. That's far better, for it's warm and jolly there."
Well, they went home with the fox to his den, and when they got inside, the fox laid on lots of fuel, so that they all got very sleepy. The duck and the goose, they settled themselves down in a corner, but the cock and hen flew up on a post. So when the goose and duck were well asleep, the fox took the goose and laid him on the embers, and roasted him. The hen smelled the strong roast meat, and sprang up to a higher peg, and said, half asleep, "Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"
"Oh, stuff!" said the fox. "It's only the smoke driven down the chimney. Go to sleep again, and hold your tongue." So the hen went off to sleep again.
Now the fox had hardly got the goose well down his throat, before he did the very same with the duck. He took and laid him on the embers, and roasted him for a dainty bit.
Then the hen woke up again, and sprang up to a higher peg still. "Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!" she said again, and when she got her eyes open, and came to see how the fox and eaten two of them, both the goose and the duck. So she flew up to the highest peg of all, and perched there, and peeped up through the chimney.
"Nay, nay, just see what a lovely lot of geese are flying over there," she said to the fox.
Out ran Reynard to fetch a fat roast. But while he was gone, the hen woke up the cock and told him how it had gone with Goosey-Poosey and Ducky-Lucky. And so Cocky-Locky and Henny-Penny flew out through the chimney, and if they hadn't got to Dovrefjell, it surely would have been all over with the world.

There was once a woman and her daughter who had a beautiful garden with cabbages. A hare got into it, and during the winter he ate all the cabbages. So the mother said to the daughter, "Go to the garden, and chase the hare away."
The girl said to the hare, "Shoo, shoo, hare! You're eating all our cabbages."
The hare said, "Come, girl, sit on my tail, and come with me to my hut."
The girl would not do that.
The next day the hare came again and ate cabbages, so the woman said to her daughter, "Go to the garden, and chase the hare away."
The girl said to the hare, "Shoo, shoo, hare! You're eating all our cabbages."
The hare said, "Come, girl, sit on my tail, and come with me to my hut."
The girl would not do that.
On the third day the hare came again and ate cabbages, so the woman said to her daughter, "Go to the garden and chase the hare away."
The girl said, "Shoo, shoo, hare! You're eating all our cabbages."
The hare said, "Come, girl, sit on my tail, and come with me to my hut."
So the girl sat on the hare's tail, and the hare took her far away to his little hut, and then said, "Now cook some green cabbage and millet. "I'm going out to invite guests to our wedding."
Then all the wedding guests arrived. Who were the wedding guests? I can tell you, because someone else told me. They were all hares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride and bridegroom, and the fox served as sexton, and their altar was under the rainbow.
But the girl was sad, for she was all alone.
The hare came up to her and said, "Open the door! Open the door! The wedding guests are making merry."
The bride cried and said nothing. The hare went away. Then the hare came back and said, "Open the door! Open the door! The wedding guests are hungry."
The bride continued to cry, and said nothing. The hare went away. Then he came back and said, "Open the door! Open the door! The wedding guests are waiting."
The bride said nothing, and the hare went away. Then she dressed a straw doll in her clothes, gave it a stirring-spoon, and stood it next to the millet pot. Then she went back to her mother.
The hare came once more and said, "Open the door! Open the door!" Then he opened the door himself and struck the doll on the head so that its cap fell off. Then the hare saw that this was not his bride, and he sadly went away.

Once upon a time there was a sorcerer who was a thief. He disguised himself as a poor man and went begging from house to house. A girl came to the door and brought him a piece of bread. He touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket. Then he carried her to his house where everything was splendid, and he gave her everything that she wanted.
One day he said, "I have to take care of something away from home. I will be away for a while. Here is an egg. Take good care of it. Carry it with you at all times. And here is a key, but at the risk of your life, do not go into the room that it opens. But as soon as he had gone, she unlocked the door and went into the room. In the middle there was a large basin. In it there were dead and dismembered people. She was so terrified that she dropped the egg, which she was holding in her hand, into the basin. She quickly took it out again and wiped off the blood, but it reappeared in an instant. She could not get the egg clean, no matter how much she wiped and scrubbed.
When the man returned, he asked for the egg and the key. He looked at them and knew that she had been in the blood chamber. "You did not heed my words," he said angrily, "and now you are going into the chamber against your will." With that he seized her, led her into the room, cut her up in pieces, and threw her into the basin with the others.
Sometime later the man went begging again. He captured the second daughter from the house, and the same thing happened to her as to the first one. She too opened the forbidden door, dropped the egg into the blood, and was cut to pieces and thrown into the basin.
Then the sorcerer wanted to have the third daughter. He captured her in his pack basket, carried her home, and at his departure gave her the egg and the key. However, the third sister was clever and sly. First of all, she put the egg in a safe place, and then she went into the secret chamber. When she saw her sisters in the basin, she found all of their parts and put each one back in its right place: head, body, arm, and leg. The parts started to move, and then they joined together, and the two sister came back to life. She took them both out of the room and hid them.
When the man returned and found that the egg was free of blood, he asked her to become his bride. She said yes, but told him that first he would have to carry a basket filled with gold on his back to her parents, and that meanwhile she would be getting ready for the wedding. Then she told her sisters to get help from home. She put them into the basket and covered them over with gold. Then she said to the man, "Carry this away. And don't you dare stop to rest. If you do, I'll be able to see through my window." He lifted the basket onto his back and started off, but it was so heavy that the weight nearly killed him. He wanted to rest a little, but one of the girls inside the basket called out, "I can see through my window that you are resting. Walk on at once!" He thought it was his bride calling out, so he got up and walked on. Every time he wanted to rest, he heard the call, and had to continue on.
Meanwhile, back at his house, his bride dressed up a skull and placed it in the attic window. Then she invited all the sorcerer's friends to the wedding. Then she dipped herself in a barrel of honey, cut open the bed, and rolled in the feathers so that no one would be able to recognize her. In this strange disguise, she left the house and started down the path. Soon she met some of the guests, who said, "You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"
"I'm coming from Fitcher's house."
"And what is his young bride doing?"
"She's cleaning the house from bottom to top. Right now she is looking out of the attic window."
Then she also met the bridegroom, who was returning home.
"You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"
"I'm coming from Fitcher's house."
"And what is my young bride doing?"
"She's cleaning the house from bottom to top. Right now she is looking out of the attic window."
The bridegroom looked up, and saw the disguised skull. Thinking it was his bride, he waved to it. But after he arrived home, and all his friends were there as well, the help came that the sisters had sent. They closed up the house and set it afire, and because no one could get out, they all perished in the flames.

Once upon a time there was an old widow who lived, with her three daughters, far away from the rest of the world, next to a mountain. She was so poor that her only animal was a single hen, which she prized as the apple of her eye. It was always cackling at her heels, and she was always running to look after it. One day, all at once, the hen was gone. The old woman went out, and walked around and around the cottage, looking and calling for her hen, but it was gone, and could not be found.
So the woman said to her oldest daughter, "You must just go out and see if you can find our hen, for we must have it back, even if we have to fetch it out of the mountain."
The daughter was ready enough to go, so she set off and walked up and down, and looked and called, but she could not find the hen. Suddenly, just as she was about to give up the hunt, she heard someone calling out from a cleft in the rock:
Your hen is in the mountain!
Your hen is in the mountain!
So she went into the cleft to see what it was, but she had barely set foot inside, when she fell through a trapdoor, deep, deep down, into an underground cavern. When she got to the bottom she went through many rooms, each finer than the one before it; but in the innermost room of all, a large ugly troll came to her and asked, "Will you be my sweetheart?"
"No! I will not," she said. She wouldn't have him for any price! All she wanted was to get above ground again as fast as ever she could, and to find her lost hen. Then the troll got so angry that he picked her up, twisted her head off, and then threw both the head and body into the cellar.
While this was going on, her mother sat at home waiting and waiting, but no daughter came. After she had waited a bit longer, and neither heard nor saw anything of her daughter, she told her middle daughter to go out and look for her sister, and, she added, "Give our hen a call at the same time."
So the second sister had to set off, and the very same thing happened to her. She was looking and calling, and suddenly she too heard a voice calling from from the cleft in the rock:
Your hen is in the mountain!
Your hen is in the mountain!
She thought that this was strange, and went to see what it was. She too fell through the trapdoor, deep, deep down, into the cavern. She too went from room to room, and in the innermost one the troll came to her and asked if she would be his sweetheart? No, she would not. All she wanted was to get above ground again, and hunt for her lost hen. The troll got angry, and picked her up, twisted her head off, and threw both head and body into the cellar.
Now, when the old woman had sat and waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her second daughter, and could neither see nor hear anything of her, she said to the youngest, "Now, you must go out and look for your sisters. It was silly to lose the hen, but it would be sillier still to lose both your sisters. Of course, you can give the hen a call at the same time." You see, the old woman's heart was still set on her hen.
Yes, the youngest was ready to go, and she walked up and down, hunting for her sisters and calling the hen, but she could neither see nor hear anything of them. She too came to the cleft in the rock, and heard something say:
Your hen is in the mountain!
Your hen is in the mountain!
She thought that this was strange, so she too went to see what it was, and she too fell through the trapdoor, deep, deep down, into a cavern. When she reached the bottom she went from one room to another, each grander than the one before it; but she wasn't at all afraid, and took time to look carefully about her. As she was peeping into this and that, she saw the trapdoor into the cellar, and looked down it, and what should she see there but her dead sisters. She barely had time to slam to the trapdoor before the troll came to her and asked, "Will you be my sweetheart?"
"With all my heart," answered the girl, for she saw very well how it had gone with her sisters. When the troll heard that, he brought her the finest clothes in the world. Indeed, she had only to ask, and she got whatever she wanted, because the troll was so glad that someone would be his sweetheart.
One day, after she had been there a little while, she was looking very gloomy and downcast, so the troll asked her what was the matter, and why she was so sad.
"Ah!" said the girl, "it's because I can't get home to my mother. I know that she has very little to eat and drink, and she has no one with her."
"Well!" said the troll, "I can't let you go to see her; but just stuff some meat and drink into a sack, and I'll carry it to her."
With many thanks, she said that she would do that. However, she put a lot of gold and silver into the bottom of the sack, then laid a little food on top. She told the ogre the sack was ready, but that he must be sure not to look into it. He gave his word not to look inside, and set off. As the troll walked off, she peeped out at him through a chink in the trapdoor. When he had gone a little way, he said, "This sack is very heavy. I'll just see what is inside." He was about to untie the the sack, when the girl called out to him, "I can still see you! I can still see you!"
"The devil you can!" said the troll; "you must have mighty sharp eyes!" And the troll did not try to look into it again. When he reached the widow's cottage, he threw the sack in through the cottage door, saying, "Here you have meat and drink from your daughter; she doesn't want for anything."
After the girl had been in the mountain a good bit longer, one day a billy goat fell down the trapdoor.
"Who sent for you, you long bearded beast!" said the troll, in an awful rage, and he picked up the goat, twisted his head off, and threw him into the cellar.
"Oh!" said the girl, "why did you do that? I might have had the goat to play with down here."
"Well!" said the troll, "you don't need to be so down in the mouth about it. I can bring the billy goat back to life again."
So saying, he took down a flask that was hanging on the wall, put the billy goat's head on his body again, and smeared it with some ointment from flask, and he was as well and as lively as before.
"Aha!" said the girl to herself; "that flask is worth something -- that it is."
When she had been in the mountain some time longer, on a day when the troll was away, she took her oldest sister, put her head on her shoulders, smeared her with some of the ointment from the flask, just as she had seen the troll do with the billy goat, and in an instant her sister came to life again.
The girl stuffed her into a sack, laid a little food over her, and when the troll came home, she said to him, "Dear friend! Now do go home to my mother with a morsel of food again. I'm certain that the poor thing is both hungry and thirsty, and besides that, she's all alone in the world. But you must not look into the sack."
He said that he would carry the sack, and that he would not look into it. But when he had gone a little way, he thought that the sack was getting very heavy; and when he had gone a bit further he said to himself, "Come what will, I must see what's inside this sack, for however sharp her eyes may be, she can't see me all this way off."
But just as he was about to untie the sack, the girl inside the sack called out, "I can still see you! I can still see you!"
"The devil you can!" said the ogre; "then you must have mighty sharp eyes," for he thought it was the girl inside the mountain who was speaking. So he didn't dare so much as to peep into the sack again, but carried it straight to her mother as fast as he could, and when he got to the cottage door he threw it in through the door, and cried out, "Here you have meat and drink from your daughter; she wants for nothing."
When the girl had been in the mountain a while longer, she did the very same thing with her other sister. She put her head on her shoulders, smeared her with ointment from the flask, brought her to life, and put her into the sack. This time she crammed in also as much gold and silver as the sack would hold, laying just a little food on top.
"Dear friend," she said to the troll, "you really must run home to my mother with a little food again; and don't look into the sack."
Yes, the troll was eager to do as she wished, and he gave his word too that he wouldn't look into the sack; but when he had gone a little way he began to think that the sack was getting very heavy, and when he had gone a bit further, he could scarce stagger along under it, so he set it down, and was just about to untie the string and look into it, when the girl inside the sack cried out, "I can still see you! I can still see you!"
"The devil you can," said the troll, "then you must have mighty sharp eyes."
Well, he did not dare to try to look into the sack, but hurried straight to the girl's mother. When he got to the cottage he threw the sack in through the door, and roared out, "Here you have food from your daughter; she wants for nothing!"
After the girl had been there a good while longer, on a day when the troll had decided to go out for the day, the girl pretended to be sick. She moaned and complained. "There's no need for you to come home before twelve o'clock tonight," she said, "for I won't be able to have supper ready before then. I'm just too sick!"
As soon as the troll was out of the house, she stuffed some of her clothes with straw, and stood this straw girl in the corner by the chimney, with a broom in her hand, so that it looked just as though she herself were standing there. After that she stole off home, and got a marksman to stay in the cottage with her mother.
So when the clock struck twelve, or thereabouts, the troll came home, and the first thing he said to the straw girl was, "Give me something to eat."
But she did not answer him.
"Give me something to eat, I say!" called out the troll, "for I am almost starved."
But she did not have a word for him.
"Give me something to eat!" roared out the ogre the third time. "I think you'd better open your ears and hear what I say, or else I'll wake you up, I will!"
But the girl stood just as still as ever; so he flew into a rage, and gave her such a slap in the face, that the straw flew all about the room. When he saw that he had been tricked, he began to hunt everywhere. When he came to the cellar, and found both the girl's sisters missing, he soon figured out what had happened, and ran off to the cottage, saying, "I'll soon pay her for this!"
But when he reached the cottage, the marksman fired off his piece. The troll did not dare go into the house, for he thought it was thunder. So he set off for home again as fast as he could run; but just as he reached the trapdoor, the sun rose and he exploded.
There's a lot of gold and silver down there still, if you only knew where the trapdoor is!

Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.
No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the stepmother began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work of the house. She scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and cleaned madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters. She slept in a sorry garret, on a wretched straw bed, while her sisters slept in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, on beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking glasses so large that they could see themselves at their full length from head to foot.
The poor girl bore it all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have scolded her; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used to go to the chimney corner, and sit down there in the cinders and ashes, which caused her to be called Cinderwench. Only the younger sister, who was not so rude and uncivil as the older one, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her coarse apparel, was a hundred times more beautiful than her sisters, although they were always dressed very richly.
It happened that the king's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among those of quality. They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in selecting the gowns, petticoats, and hair dressing that would best become them. This was a new difficulty for Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sister's linen and pleated their ruffles. They talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed.
"For my part," said the eldest, "I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming."
"And I," said the youngest, "shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered cloak, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world."
They sent for the best hairdresser they could get to make up their headpieces and adjust their hairdos, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.
They also consulted Cinderella in all these matters, for she had excellent ideas, and her advice was always good. Indeed, she even offered her services to fix their hair, which they very willingly accepted. As she was doing this, they said to her, "Cinderella, would you not like to go to the ball?"
"Alas!" said she, "you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go to such a place."
"You are quite right," they replied. "It would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball."
Anyone but Cinderella would have fixed their hair awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well. They were so excited that they hadn't eaten a thing for almost two days. Then they broke more than a dozen laces trying to have themselves laced up tightly enough to give them a fine slender shape. They were continually in front of their looking glass. At last the happy day came. They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could. When she lost sight of them, she started to cry.
Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.
"I wish I could. I wish I could." She was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.
This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, "You wish that you could go to the ball; is it not so?"
"Yes," cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.
"Well," said her godmother, "be but a good girl, and I will contrive that you shall go." Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, "Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin."
Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could help her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, leaving nothing but the rind. Having done this, she struck the pumpkin with her wand, and it was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.
She then went to look into her mousetrap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor. She gave each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse colored dapple gray.
Being at a loss for a coachman, Cinderella said, "I will go and see if there is not a rat in the rat trap that we can turn into a coachman."
"You are right," replied her godmother, "Go and look."
Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The fairy chose the one which had the largest beard, touched him with her wand, and turned him into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers that eyes ever beheld.
After that, she said to her, "Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering pot. Bring them to me."
She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The fairy then said to Cinderella, "Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not pleased with it?"
"Oh, yes," she cried; "but must I go in these nasty rags?"
Her godmother then touched her with her wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay past midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and that her clothes would become just as they were before.
She promised her godmother to leave the ball before midnight; and then drove away, scarcely able to contain herself for joy. The king's son, who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, had arrived, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she alighted from the coach, and led her into the hall, among all the company. There was immediately a profound silence. Everyone stopped dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so entranced was everyone with the singular beauties of the unknown newcomer.
Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of, "How beautiful she is! How beautiful she is!"
The king himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and telling the queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.
All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, hoping to have some made next day after the same pattern, provided they could find such fine materials and as able hands to make them.
The king's son led her to the most honorable seat, and afterwards took her out to dance with him. She danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine meal was served up, but the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.
She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hurried away as fast as she could.
Arriving home, she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go to the ball the next day as well, because the king's son had invited her.
As she was eagerly telling her godmother everything that had happened at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.
"You stayed such a long time!" she cried, gaping, rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been sleeping; she had not, however, had any manner of inclination to sleep while they were away from home.
"If you had been at the ball," said one of her sisters, "you would not have been tired with it. The finest princess was there, the most beautiful that mortal eyes have ever seen. She showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons."
Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter. Indeed, she asked them the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the king's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied, "She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been! Could not I see her? Ah, dear Charlotte, do lend me your yellow dress which you wear every day."
"Yes, to be sure!" cried Charlotte; "lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you are! I should be such a fool."
Cinderella, indeed, well expected such an answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it, if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly.
The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed even more magnificently than before. The king's son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her. All this was so far from being tiresome to her, and, indeed, she quite forgot what her godmother had told her. She thought that it was no later than eleven when she counted the clock striking twelve. She jumped up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the prince picked up most carefully. She reached home, but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left of all her finery but one of the little slippers, the mate to the one that she had dropped.
The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out. They replied that they had seen nobody leave but a young girl, very shabbily dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.
When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them if they had been well entertained, and if the fine lady had been there.
They told her, yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the king's son had picked up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.
What they said was very true; for a few days later, the king's son had it proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot this slipper would just fit. They began to try it on the princesses, then the duchesses and all the court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to force their foot into the slipper, but they did not succeed.
Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew that it was her slipper, said to them, laughing, "Let me see if it will not fit me."
Her sisters burst out laughing, and began to banter with her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said that it was only just that she should try as well, and that he had orders to let everyone try.
He had Cinderella sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found that it went on very easily, fitting her as if it had been made of wax. Her two sisters were greatly astonished, but then even more so, when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her other foot. Then in came her godmother and touched her wand to Cinderella's clothes, making them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had worn before.
And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, said that she forgave them with all her heart, and wanted them always to love her.
She was taken to the young prince, dressed as she was. He thought she was more charming than before, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the court.

Once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field in common. They found a small clearing far away in the forest, where they sowed rye the first year.
"Now we must share and share alike," said Reynard. "If you will have the roots I will have the tops," he said.
Yes, Bruin was quite willing. But when they had threshed the crop, the fox got all the grain, while the bear got nothing but the roots and tares.
Bruin didn't like this, but the fox said it was only as they had agreed. "This year I am the gainer," said the fox. "Another year it will be your turn. You can then have the tops, and I will be satisfied with the roots."
Next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn't think turnips would be the right thing for that year.
"Yes, that better food than grain," said the bear, and the fox thought the same.
When the autumn came the fox took the turnips, but the bear only got the tops.
The bear then became so angry that he parted company then and there with Reynard.

Once upon a time there was a clever, wily peasant, whose tricks could be much talked about. The best story, however, is how he once got the best of the devil and made a fool of him. One day the peasant had been working in his field, and just as it was getting dark he was getting ready to go home when in the middle of his field he saw a pile of burning coals. Filled with amazement he walked toward it, and sitting on the top of the glowing coals there was a little black devil.
"You must be sitting on a treasure," said the peasant.
"Yes indeed," replied the devil, "on a treasure that contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life."
"The treasure is in my field and belongs to me," said the peasant.
"It is yours," answered the devil, "if for two years you will give me one half of everything your field produces. I have enough money, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth."
The peasant entered into the bargain, saying, "To prevent any dispute from arising about the division, everything above the ground shall belong to you, and everything beneath the ground to me."
The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had planted turnips.
Now when harvest time came the devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop, but he found nothing except the yellow withered leaves, and the happy peasant dug up his turnips.
"You got the best of me this time," said the devil, "but it won't happen again. Next time what grows above ground shall be yours, and what is under it shall be mine."
"That is all right with me," answered the peasant. When planting time came the peasant did not plant turnips again, but wheat. The crop ripened, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks off at ground level. When the devil came he found nothing but the stubble, and he angrily disappeared into a chasm in a cliff.
"That's the way one has to deal with foxes," said the peasant, then carried away the treasure.

A fox and a wolf found an old horse in a mire. They wanted to take it with them and asked one another how they might manage.
The fox said, "You are the strongest. Tie the horse's tail around your body and pull, while I prod the horse with a stick."
That happened, and soon the horse was out of the mud, but it then ran off with the wolf tied to its tail.
"Claw your paws into the ground!" cried the fox.
"But I can see neither heaven nor earth!" answered the wolf.
Finally the wolf succeeded in breaking loose, and he and the fox continued on their way, but without the horse.

It was Whitsuntide; the forest and the fields were happy with flowers and sweet singing birds. All the beasts were stirring, for this was the day when the great meeting of animals was to take place. King Lion had bidden all his subjects to come to his court. None must be absent. So along every way they came: the wolf, the wild cat, the dog, the panther, the badger, Bruin the Bear, and a host of others. One alone was not there, and that was Reynard the Fox.
Why he was absent was soon seen. There was hardly one of the beasts who had not some complaint to make about him. The angriest one of all was the wolf.
"Your Majesty," he said, "will you please punish that rascal Reynard? Not a day passes when he does not do some mischief to me. It would take many a week to tell you of all the evil he has done. Three of my little children are now sitting at home crying because Reynard has blinded them with dust."
"You are not the only one he has harmed," said the dog. "One winter, great king, Reynard stole my last meal, a piece of sausage which I had hidden in a bush."
"You have little to grumble about," said the wild cat. "The sausage was mine, Your Majesty! I took it from a shelf in the mill while the miller's wife was asleep. The dog stole it from me."
"Look what Reynard did to the hare!" said the panther, pointing to a wound in the hare's neck. "This poor fellow met the fox last week. 'Let me teach you how to say your prayers in Latin,' said Reynard, 'and then you will be able to take a good post in the church.' The hare agreed, and Reynard made him get down on his knees, but before he had said half a dozen words Reynard seized him by the throat, and if I had not come along just then he certainly would have killed him."
"These tales would not be told if my uncle were present," cried Reynard's nephew, the badger, angrily. "The wolf has treated my uncle in a very evil manner more than once. Some time ago the wolf and Reynard agreed to work together and share whatever food they got. One day as they were walking behind the hedge that borders the road they saw a man come along with a cartload of fish. Their mouths watered, for they were both hungry, and Reynard soon thought of a plan to get some of the fish.
"You stay behind the cart and keep a good watch," he said to the wolf. Then he ran along by the hedge, and came out into the road a long way in front of the carter. Here he lay down in a rut, and when the cart drew near, shut his eyes, held his breath and stiffened his body.
"Ah!" said the man when he saw Reynard. "Here's a dead fox. His skin ought to fetch a good sum of money in the next town." With that he picked up the fox and threw him on the back of the cart. No sooner was the man's back turned than Reynard came to life again. Fish after fish he kicked into the roadway, while the wolf followed and picked them up.
When the fox had thrown down enough, he jumped to the wolf for a share of the plunder.
Here is your share,' said the wolf as he pointed to a heap of fish bones. "I hope you'll enjoy the feast." And off he went.
"Well!" said the king, "is there anything more?"
"There is," said the badger. "Another time the wolf and the fox heard that a peasant had killed a fat pig and hung it up on a wooden peg in his larder. They both felt very hungry for this pig, so they went to the peasant's house. After a great deal of trouble my uncle was able to get through a window into the larder. With a struggle he managed to throw the pig, peg as well, out of the window. The wolf ran off with the prize, leaving Reynard to get out as best he could. When the fox did get out of the house he was set upon by the peasant's dogs. They gave him a sorry time, but after a long run he escaped from them and made his way back.
"When he came up to the wolf, who looked fat and happy, he could see no sign of the pig. "Haven't you saved any for me?" he asked angrily.
"Why, of course," answered the wolf. "Nobody can say I am greedy. Here's a tasty titbit for you." And he flung the fox the wooden peg on which the pig had been hung."
Just as the badger ended his tale there was a commotion outside, and the next minute there marched into the court a very strange procession.
In front was Henning the Cock; behind him were two young cocks, bearing a bier on which lay the headless body of Henning's daughter, Scratchfoot. On either side walked a brother of the dead hen carrying a white candle; and after the brothers came many relations of the deceased, all crying most miserably.
"What does all this mean?" asked the king.
"Alas! sire!" said Henning, pointing to the bier, "this is Reynard's work. I had ten sons and fifteen daughters and we all lived happily in a farmyard belonging to rich monks. Round the yard was a strong wall, and six large dogs were inside to protect us. Many a time has Reynard tried to get into the yard, but the dogs at last gave him such a bad time that he left us alone.
"One day we heard a knocking at the gate, and looking over, I saw the fox dressed as a hermit.
"You need not be afraid of me any more," he said. "I have taken a vow never again to eat flesh. I am going to read holy books and pray for the rest of my life. My only food will be berries and barley bread. Goodbye, dear Henning, for it is now time for me to go and say my prayers."
I called all my children together and told them the good news; that they need no longer go in mortal fear of the fox. Away out of the gate they ran. But that sly Reynard was hiding in a bush, and in a moment he sprang upon my children and killed fifteen of them. Poor Scratchfoot's body was the only one he did not eat, for the dogs came along just in time to stop him."
When the king heard Henning's sad story he was very angry with Reynard and his nephew, the badger.
He ordered that Scratchfoot should be given a grand funeral, and caused a marble slab to be placed over her grave; and on the slab these words were written:
"Here lies Scratchfoot,
Daughter of Henning the Cock,
She was skilful in scratching,
and laid many eggs."
As for Reynard, a messenger was to be sent to order him to appear at the court at once. Bruin the Bear was chosen as messenger.
"Be careful," said the king, before Bruin started. "Reynard is full of sly ways, and he will play a trick on you if you are not watchful."
"I know all his tricks," said the bear proudly. "He won't get the better of me."

Bruin started off at once on his journey to find the fox and give him the king's order.
Now Reynard was rich enough to own several houses. The strongest of them all was the Castle of Malpertuis, built high among the rocks. Here the fox was able to hide himself, even if his enemies got over the strong walls. Underneath the house ran thousands of passages, all twisted and dark, and nobody knew his way along these passages except Reynard and his wife. So Bruin set out to find Reynard, and after visiting all his houses in turn came at last to the Castle of Malpertuis.
The gates were locked, and everything was quiet when the bear arrived. Bang! Bang! knocked Bruin on the door.
Not a sound was heard.
"Reynard! Reynard!" he cried loudly. "Open the door. I am Bruin the Bear, and I come from King Lion to bid you appear before him at once."
Still not a sound was heard; for although the fox heard every word, he was not going to open the gate till he knew that the bear was alone.
When he was certain that only the bear was outside he ran inside and put on his hermit's gown. Then, holding a book in his hand, he opened the gate.
"I am very sorry I have kept you waiting. I was just in the middle of my prayers. You cannot know how pleased I am to see you. Come inside and rest yourself. I am not feeling well enough to start for the court today. You know I've given up eating flesh, and honey is the only food that is plentiful about here. I am afraid I feel ill through the eating of too much of the nasty stuff."
"Nasty stuff!" said Bruin. To him, honey was the nicest thing on earth. "If you can show me where to get my fill I will do my best for you at the court."
"Do you say so?" answered Reynard. "Why, I know a place where there is so much honey that you could not drink it dry in seven years. If you will be a friend to me at court I will show you the place."
"Let us go at once," said Bruin, whose mouth was watering. "I will do all I can for you
So the two set off for the farmyard of a woodcutter who lived in the valley. In the yard lay a huge oak tree which the woodcutter had felled the day before. To split this he had driven in two big wedges which made a great crack right along the trunk. No one was in the yard, for the woodcutter had gone into the house for a nap.
"Here is the well," said Reynard, pointing to the crack in the tree. "Put your mouth down as far as you can and eat as much honey as you like."
It was not long before Bruin had his head and forefeet in the crack, and as soon as Reynard saw that the bear was busy he gave a hard tug at the wedges. Out they came, the trunk closed up, and Bruin was caught in a trap.
Such a roaring and struggling as the bear set up! You never heard such a noise. The fox grinned, and told himself it was time to be off.
"How do you like the taste of the honey?" said Reynard. "Do not eat too much, for the woodcutter will bring you something else to eat in a moment. Good day!" and off he went.
Meanwhile, the woodcutter, hearing the noise, came out to see what was the matter. When he saw what had happened he shouted: "Neighbours! Here's a bear caught in my yard. Come and have some sport!"
Everybody in the village left his work to come. Some carried sticks, some spades, some axes, and others hammers. All had some weapon to beat poor Bruin. So great a hail of blows rained on his back that with a furious tug he pulled himself free from the tree, leaving behind him his ears and claws. Away he went down the road, and away after him went the crowd. Sticks were thrown at him, and at every corner someone would spring out and give him a blow. Blinded with pain he neither saw nor cared where he went, and suddenly he ran into a crowd of women who were standing by the river watching the fun.
Over went the priest's cook into the water. "Two silver crowns to the man who gets her out," shouted the Priest. Every one left the bear to save the cook. Bruin took the chance of escape, and jumped into the river and swam away.
A mile or two down the river he climbed on the bank, and for a long time lay as if dead. Then he arose and turned towards home.
For four days he crawled along, covered with bruises and blood. Hardly able to put one foot before the other he reached the court. No one would have seen in the miserable creature that returned the lordly bear who had gone out a few days before.
"Surely this is not Bruin," said the king. "Whatever has happened?"
When the bear had told his story the king's anger was terrible to see, and he uttered threats of vengeance.
Where strength has failed cunning may succeed," said he. "I will send the cat to fetch Reynard to court. He is not very big, but he has all his wits about him."

The cat did not care very much for the work he had to do; but he started off, making up his mind not to be tricked as Bruin had been. It was evening when he reached Malpertius and found Reynard sitting in his front garden.
"Good evening!" said the cat. "The king orders you to return with me without delay." "I hope you are in good health," answered the fox. "I will certainly come with you in the morning. In the meantime, will you not step inside and have something to eat? I would have returned with Bruin, only he was such an ill-mannered fellow."
"I think we had better go at once," said the cat. "It is a fine night; the moon is shining and the roads are dry." "But, my dear Cat," said Reynard, "it is so much more pleasant in the daytime, and all sorts of rascals are about at night."
"Well, if I stay, what can you give me to eat?" asked the cat.
"I am very poor and live plainly," said Reynard, "but I think I can find you a good meal of honey."
"No!" said the cat, remembering in what a sad state poor Bruin had come back. "I am not fond of honey. Now, if you had a mouse, I could manage with that."
"Mouse!" said the fox, "why, I know a barn not far from here where there are wagon-loads of mice. The priest who lives there is always grumbling about the mischief they do."
"I should very much like to go and see the place that you speak of," said the cat.
"Come on, then," said Reynard, and away down the road the two went together.
A day or two before this the fox had found out that the priest kept his chickens in the barn. So he made a big hole under the wall and stole the finest bird he could find. The priest's little son, Martin, had made up his mind to catch the fox if he came that way again, so getting a piece of string he had tied one end to a nail, and at the other end he had made a slip-knot, which he placed over the hole. But Reynard was too clever to be caught easily. It did not take him long to find out about the trap that had been set for him, and he had taken good care not to venture inside that barn again.
Here's the place," said Reynard, when they reached the barn. "Can't you hear the mice squeaking? The hole at the bottom of the wall leads right inside. I'll keep watch outside while you go in; but don't be long, for we must be up early in the morning to make ready for our journey."
In went the cat, and before he knew what had happened the slip-knot was round his neck. He tugged and tugged, but the more he pulled the tighter the string became, and the poor thing felt that he would very soon choke.
"Are the mice tasty and fat?" shouted Reynard through the hole. "Don't make so much noise or you'll frighten them all away. It's a pity you have to eat them cold, but Martin will bring you something warm in a minute," and, calling on his way at another farmyard to get a chicken for supper, the fox trotted home.
The noise made by the cat awoke Martin, whose bedroom was close by. "Father, get up!" he shouted. "The fox is caught in my trap!"
Up jumped the priest, and putting on a cloak, he ran downstairs with Martin to the barn. The servants all rushed out of their bedrooms when they heard the clatter, thinking that the house must be on fire. Away went all of them pell-mell to the barn to repay the fox for his theft. It was too dark to see that it was no Fox that was caught in the trap, so the poor cat got a terrible beating, besides being blinded in one eye. Mad with pain, he sprang at the nearest person to him, who happened to be the priest. The priest's legs were so covered with bites and scratches that he had to be carried into the house and the cat was left alone.
Though he nearly felt dead he knew that now was his only chance of getting free, for if his enemies returned there would be little left of him. So he gnawed as hard as he could at the string, and was just able to get loose as some of the servants returned.
Next morning, into the court of King Lion there walked the most miserable cat that anyone ever saw. Blind in one eye, covered with bruises, and with patches of fur missing, he looked the most unhappy of cats. When the king heard his tale he was angrier than ever.
"I will punish Reynard without a trial," he said. "He has had too many chances. Call all of my soldiers together; we will burn him out of Malpertius and give him no mercy."
"Great King!" said the badger. "Reynard may have done much wrong, but he has the right to be called to court three times. If he does not come the next time, then let him be found guilty. Please allow him to be sent for once more."
Well! as you are so anxious for Reynard," said the lion, you shall fetch him yourself. Mind you do not return without him, or you will be sorry for it."

Off then went Grimbert the Badger, and it was not long before he was knocking at the door of Castle Malpertius. Reynard himself came and let him in, and then led the way to an inner room, where his wife lay with a litter of cubs around her.
"Good morning, dear Uncle and Aunt," said Grimbert. "I am glad to see you and the children so well."
"Good morning," said Reynard, "and what brings you all this way?"
"Well, to tell the truth," said Grimbert, "the king sent me to bring you to court, and if you take my advice, you will come quietly, for he is very angry with you. If you do not come, he swears that he will lay siege to your castle, or burn you out of it, if necessary!"
Will the king try to punish me?" asked Reynard.
"Yes, he will," said the badger; "but what need you care about that? Have you not still your nimble wit and cunning? They will not fail you, I am sure. Many a time have you run much greater risks."
Reynard thought for a little. "Very well, nephew," he said at last, "I will return with you. Let us set out at once. And you, wife," he added, turning to the mother fox, "take care of the little ones while I am away, and especially Reynkin. I love him the best of all, for every day he grows more like myself, and should make a fox of renown in time!"
Then, after taking a tender farewell of his wife and the children, the two set out, and before long arrived at the court of King Lion.
All the beasts were gathered together in the judgement place, for the news of Reynard's coming had spread far and wide. There sat King Lion on his throne with the queen beside him. On one side the tiger held the royal flag, and on the other was the leopard. Bruin the Bear had a front place, and sat rubbing his sore nose. And there, too, was Tybert the Cat, with the rope that had nearly choked him still hanging round his neck.
Reynard did not show any sign of fear. Marching boldly up to the throne, he bowed low and said: "Hail, king! Reynard, your sometimes faithful servant comes at your command. They tell me that beasts have spoken evil of me. Let them speak my face, and I will answer them!"
"Peace vile traitor!" cried the king. Not again shall your cunning words deceive me. Answer me that: Have you kept the peace I proclaimed throughout my realm?"
At this the cock, who had been listening eagerly, could no longer keep silence, and called out:
"Aye, the peace! Did he keep the peace when he killed my children?"
"Hold your tongue,"' said the king. "Justice shall be done." Then to the fox he said: ' Robber and murderer, answer for what you did to my good friends Bruin the Bear and Tybert the Cat."
"Answer, indeed," grumbled the fox. "Is it my fault if Bruin has a sore nose? He stole the farmer's honey and got a good beating for his pains. Am I to blame? As for Tybert the Cat, I did all I could to stop him from going to the priest's house, but he took no notice. He loved mice better than good deeds. Am I to blame for that?"
At this the Ram started forward. "There is no truth in what this villain says, King!" he cried. "He has deserved death. Let him die!"
And then all the other beasts cried out for Reynard to be given up to them.
And loudest of all cried Bruin the Bear, and Isegrim the wolf, and Tybert the Cat, and Chanticleer the Cock. Even the timid hare, though he was trembling with fright, raised his voice, and the goose came and quacked her loudest.
So loud grew the din that it was a long time before the king could make himself heard. Then, "Let him be arrested," he cried, "and cast into prison. We will decide what his punishment shall be."

It did not take the court very long to decide that Reynard was guilty of all the crimes with which he had been charged. He had not a single friend among the animals, except Grimbert the Badger, and although Grimbert did his best to save him, it was all in vain. Reynard was brought from prison to hear his doom.
"Reynard," said King Lion, "you have been judged fairly, and found guilty of murder, theft, and many other crimes. The sentence of the court is that you shall be hanged. Have you anything to say?"
The wily fox at once began a long and flattering speech, for he thought that even at the last minute he might get off. The king listened gravely, but in silence, and at the end signed for the fox to be taken away to the place of execution.
Tybert the Cat, Isegrim the Wolf, and Bruin the Bear had been chosen as executioners, and they at once seized upon poor Reynard and dragged him off to a high tree that stood close by.
"Here is a gallows ready-made for us," said Isegrim. "Let us make haste and hang the villain, for he is so cunning that if we delay he may escape us again!"
"Yes, make haste," said the fox. I wish nothing better than to be put out of my misery. See, Tybert has a cord. It hangs round his neck. It is the same one that nearly choked him to death when he went to steal the priest's mice. He is good at climbing. Let him hurry and fix the rope."
"That's the first wise thing I've heard you say today," grumbled Bruin the Bear. "Up with you, Tybert. We'll hold him fast while you go."
So Tybert ran quickly up the tree and tied the rope on to a stout branch. Then a ladder was brought, and everything was ready.
"Now," said Bruin, "say your prayers, villain, for you have only two minutes more!"
"Before I die," said Reynard, At first the Bear flatly refused, but Reynard told him what he had to say was very important, and at last he agreed. So the king and queen came up to the gallows tree.
"What is it you want?" asked King Lion.
"I wish to beg one boon, O King," said Reynard. "Before I die let me confess my sins to you and plead for your forgiveness."
"I have led a very wicked life, O King," said Reynard. "I freely confess it, and I am sorry for it. But yet there is a good deal to be said for me. It is true I killed Chanticleer's children, the little chickens, but then it is my nature to kill, and my mother taught me so to get my food. It is true also that by cunning tricks I got the better of Tybert the Cat and Bruin the Bear, but then it is my nature to be cunning, and this my mother taught me also. Sly Reynard am I called with truth, but if I had not been sly I should long ago have died of starvation!" "And a good riddance!" said Bruin.
Reynard did not even look at him. "A hard life was mine from my babyhood, your Majesty," he went on. "Many a day have I gone hungry, and many a time have I been nearly beaten to death by men when I went to rob their hen roosts. Only one stroke of fortune have I ever had in all my life, and that was when I discovered a cave full of silver and gold."
The king pricked up his ears at this.
"A cave full of gold, you say?" he asked.
"Yes, your Majesty," sighed Reynard. "A cave full of treasures so rich that nobody could count them all - silver and gold and precious stones past all belief. Little good will those riches do me now when I am so soon to die."
"But, Reynard, my dear friend," said the king, "you will surely not die before you have told me where I can find these wonderful treasures!"
"Alas!" answered Reynard, "I would gladly tell Your Majesty if you alone were concerned, but how can I speak in front of all these creatures who hate me, and who, even now, when I am so near to death, think that I am merely telling you a lying tale to save my skin?"
It was true. Bruin the Bear was already opening his mouth to speak, and Tybert the Cat was pulling at the rope, for they both saw their enemy about to escape from their hands.
The king, too, had doubts, but his greed overcame his prudence, and he bade all the animals stand back.
"Now, Reynard," said he," we are alone and nobody can hear. Tell me where this cave of treasures lies."
Then Reynard looked at the king and hid a smile, for he knew that his life was safe.
"And what reward will Your Majesty give me," he asked boldly, "if I make you richer than any of the kings on the earth?"
"Why, what reward do you wish?" asked the king.
"My life!" said Reynard, "my life to serve you well from now on, and to be at your command."
The king was silent a moment. Then, "I grant it," he said. "Now, tell me quickly."
"Will Your Majesty not first of all tell all the creatures that you have shown me mercy?" asked the cunning Reynard. He knew that once King Lion had declared his will to his subjects he would not for very pride depart from it.
So then King Lion stepped back from the tree, and bending down, picked up a straw from the grass. Then, turning to his people, he gravely broke the straw in two and said:.
"Even as this straw is broken, so I declare the law broken that condemned my friend Reynard to death. He has proved to me his goodwill. Cast off his bonds and set him free!"
There was an angry cry from all the beasts, but it was kept under, for none dared to rebel against the king's command. Grimbert the Badger ran eagerly forward and hastened to undo the rope from his uncle's neck.
"Clever Reynard!" he whispered. "Did I not tell you that your wit was more than a match for these dullards! Look how Tybert the Cat is swelling his tail! He can hardly see for anger!"

As soon as Reynard was set free, the king commanded him to come and tell him of the whereabouts of the treasure.
"All in good time," said Reynard. "First let me describe the cave itself and how I found it. One day, when I was out hunting, I came upon a hole, and thinking it would make a fine earth for me I entered. The hole was narrow at first and winding, and after a time it widened out, and I found myself in a vast hall lit by many lamps. What did I see there? How can I describe the wonders that met my eyes?"
"Gold?" asked the king, licking his dry lips.
"Aye, gold and gold and gold! Golden vessels and vases and bars, gold-embroidered robes, and golden armour, and swords and spears. Gold in heaps so that the eye was dazzled by it. And this was not all," Reynard went on, looking towards the queen, "for there also, in bales and packages, were sparkling jewels necklaces and bracelets of diamonds flashing in the light, and ropes of pearls, beautiful as the sheen on the sea!"
"And crowns, too?" asked the queen, "diamond crowns for ladies' brows?"
"Yes, by all means," said the fox, "even crowns of a richness and value to match your beauty."
"But where is the cave?" asked the king. "I am all on fire to go to it. Tell me at once."
"In Flanders," said the fox, "there is a deep, dark forest called Hulsterlo. Dreary it is, and dense, and dark, and the fierce wind howls through it. And near this forest is a pool called Krekynpit. Mark well that word, for it is the key that will unlock the treasure cave. I alone in all the world know the secret, and I will tell it to you.
"When you get to the forest you must find the pool. And when you have found the pool you must walk along its sides until you come to a place where it splits in two, leaving a narrow neck of land in between. You will easily know the place, for on that split of land grow two poplar trees, so tall that they tower above all the other trees in the forest. Search among the roots of these trees and you will find two small white stones, graved with a skull and crossbones. From these step six paces to the right, and there, if you stamp your feet, an empty hollow sound will answer you. Dig in that place about six feet down, and you will come to a door, fast barred and locked. No key will open it, nor will any strength break it down. But here is what you must do. Step back from the door and say these magic words;
"King I am.
Each man who holds dear his life
Fears my name.
Yield  I bid you obey,
I brook no delay.
Bolts and bars, away!
"Three times you must speak these words, and the door will open to you."

The king stood silent for a moment after Reynard had ended his tale of the wonderful treasure. Then, stroking his beard, he said:.
"It all sounds very fine, but where is this wood named Hulsterlo, and the lake called Krekynpit? London I have heard of, and Paris too; butI never heard of Krekynpit in my life."
Reynard turned on the king with an injured air.
"Does Your Majesty, then, doubt my word?" he asked. "If you will forgive my saying so, you must have but a very small knowledge of geography. Everybody knows the wood of Hulsterlo, even Cuwaert the Hare here. Stand forth, Cuwaert, and tell the king!"
The poor hare had never heard of the place in his life, but stepped forward tremblingly. He felt Reynard's baleful glance upon him, and dared not tell the truth. "I should say I know it, Your Majesty," he stammered. "Hulsterlo is the name of the wood and Krekynpit the name of the lake. They are dreary places both of them, and nobody ever found any good there to my knowledge. They are in the county of, now, let me see - in the county of -"
That will do, Cuwaert," said Reynard hurriedly. "Step back to your place, my friend, and don't weary His Majesty with your talk."
"It is all very well," said the king, "but I am not much wiser than I was before. I will tell you what, Reynard. You yourself shall lead us to the place where the treasure is hidden. And," here the king's voice grew very stern "woe to you if you cannot find it!"
For a moment the wily fox was dumbfounded, but he quickly recovered himself. "I will lead the way with pleasure, Your Majesty," he answered. But think a little before you order me to do a thing that may work harm to your fair fame. I am quite ready to set out for Krekynpit this moment, if you like, but have you forgotten that I am under the ban of the Church for that little matter of robbing the priest's farmyard? If you go on a journey with me as your companion you will bring the wrath of the Church down on your own head also, and that, as you know, is a very serious thing."
"You are right," said the king thoughtfully. "But what, then, are we to do?"
Reynard pretended to think very hard. "I have it, Your Majesty," he said at last. There is no particular hurry for us to make this journey. The treasure is quite safe. Nobody will steal it, I should say. Let me set off at once to Rome to ask pardon from the pope. Then, when I come back, all will be well, and we can start at once."
"That is not a bad idea," said the king, "but how am I to ensure that once out of my reach you will ever come back? You have deceived me before, you know!"
Why, as to that," answered Reynard, "you can send somebody with me. Here's Cuwaert the Hare who can run faster than I can myself; one would not escape from him in a hurry. Let him be sent with me, and Bellyn the Ram as well. I ask for Bellyn because, as everybody knows, he is a very good-living beast, and before I ask the pope for pardon I would like to improve my mind by listening to his talk."
"It sounds a good idea," said the king again. "Very good, then, set off with you at once, and be as quick as you can, for I don't mind telling you that I am all on fire to enter the cave and see the gold. You, Cuwaert, and you, Bellyn, look after Reynard, and see that he does not play any tricks. I hold you responsible for his safe-keeping."

Soon afterwards the fox and his two companions set off on their long journey. The pope lived at Rome, and Rome was a very long way off  many weeks' journey, even though they travelled at the top of their speed all the time.
No sooner were they out of sight of the King's Court than Reynard said:.
"I am so glad you have been able to come with me, dear friends. I asked for you, Cuwaert, and you, Bellyn, because I well know that you are the only two among all the beasts who are to be trusted. Never had a fox such faithful friends, and I am looking forward immensely to our journey together. Before we go, however, I would like to say farewell to my wife. Poor thing, she does not know yet that I am a changed beast. She has often wept over my sins, and she will be full of joy to hear that I have repented, and that I am to ask forgiveness of the pope. My Castle of Malpertuis is not very far out of our road. I am sure you will not mind coming there with me. I will not stay long."
The hare and the ram both agreed, and before long the three stood at the gate of Reynard's castle.
"Here we are," said the fox cheerfully. "Now, Bellyn, you wait outside here. I have something important I want to say to Cuwaert, so he can go in with me. There is no other gate to the castle, so I cannot get out without your knowing."
The solemn and stupid old ram at once sat down on the step to wait, while Cuwaert and the fox entered the castle. Through the underground passages Reynard led the way until they came at last to the inner chamber where the vixen lay with her cubs.
They entered, and Reynard carefully closed and locked the door.
"Good day, wife," he said. "Here I am, you see, come back again like a bad penny all safe and sound, ha, ha! And I've brought my dear friend Cuwaert to see you, the sweetest companion a fox ever had."
His wicked eyes gleamed.
"Why, husband," said the vixen, "I am glad indeed to see you back again. I made sure that the king would lock you up in prison or do something else equally unpleasant.How did you manage to get away?"
"Oh," answered Reynard, "I told His Majesty about the treasure of Krekynpit, and he was so anxious to get his paws on the gold that he sent me off to Rome to ask pardon for my sins from the pope, so that I could lead him to it!"
"The treasure of Krekynpit?" said the vixen, puzzled. "What is that? I have never heard of it."
"Nor I, either, until this morning," answered Reynard. "But I made up a beautiful story about it and it was good enough for the king, wasn't it, Cuwaert, my friend?"
He turned his gaze upon the trembling hare, who now saw that he had been trapped and was crouching in a corner.
"Let me out, Reynard," he implored; "let me out, and I will promise not to tell the king!"
"What!" roared the fox. "You would be a traitor to His Majesty, would you? You would be false to our good King Nobel, who put his trust in you? What shall we do, wife, with such a rogue?"
He began to creep stealthily towards the poor hare, licking his chops and glowering.
"Help, Bellyn, help!" screamed Cuwaert. The fox is going to kill me. Come quickly or I am lost."
But he had hardly uttered the words before the cruel fox was at his throat, and a minute later there was an end of Cuwaert!.
"There's meat for us for a long time," said the fox, rising. "Fools that they are, all of them, to match their wits against mine! Now, wife, we had better get away quickly from this place, for very soon we shall have the hue and cry out after us. I know a wood, not far from here, where there is plenty of shelter, and everything we may require. The coverts in it are full of fat pheasants and partridges; there are shady dells where you and the young ones can take your ease, and there is plenty of fresh water."
"I would much rather stay where I am," answered his wife,"and I think you would be wise to stay here too. What can the king do? Even if he comes and lays siege to the castle, you know very well he could never catch us. There are a thousand different passages here underground, and many different holes to escape from. He might as well look for a needle in a haystack as search for us, even if he gained an entrance."
So they began to argue the matter. And all the time they were talking old Belly the Ram sat solemn and grave as a judge, waiting patiently for Reynard to come out.
At last, even the ram's patience gave way, and he called out angrily: "Come along, you two! How much longer are you going to keep me waiting here? Do you think that I have nothing better to do than to sit on a cold step all day?"
There was no answer.
"Come, Reynard," he cried again. "It's a very long farewell you are taking. I could have said good-bye in a quarter of the time!"
At this, Reynard, who had heard his shouts, put his head out of the door and said:.
"Don't be angry, dear Bellyn. Good Cuwaert is within, comforting my wife, I can tell you. Nothing will persuade her that I am not going to my death. I could not stand all the crying any longer, and simply had to come away."
"So that was the sound I heard," said Bellyn. "I fancied I heard a cry a while ago, but it sounded to me like Cuwaert's voice. For the moment I thought he was crying for help."
"For help!" said Reynard reprovingly. "Do you, then, think so ill of me as to fear that anything could happen to him in my house? I know I have been wicked, but I hope I have not fallen so low as to betray a guest!"
"It is all right," said Bellyn; "it must have been my fancy."
"I forgive you," said the fox, smiling sweetly. "Now I will tell you what to do, Bellyn. I have just thought of a message I must send to the king with a parcel. Will you take them back for me? By the time you return Cuwaert will be ready, and we will all set out together."
Bellyn agreed, and the fox, going back to his chamber, took the head of poor Cuwaert and put it into a bag, and having tied the bag tightly, sealed it, and delivered it to the ram to take to the king.

The cunning fox had pretended to set off with the ram and hare to Rome. But by artful words he brought the two to his Castle of Malpertuis, where he killed the hare. Now he was going to send his head in a bag to the king.
The stupid ram believed everything that Reynard said, and when the fox told him that the bag contained an important letter, he was only too anxious to be off. "Let me tie it round your neck," said Reynard. "This letter is far too valuable to be lost. I would not have the king miss it for all I own in the world. You must take care of it, Bellyn!" "Trust me!" said the Ram. "I'd like to see anybody try to take it from me, that's all!"
"And whatever you do," said Reynard, "don't open the bag and look at what is inside it - secret things. If the king thought you had opened the bag, or as much as peeped into it, he would at once order you to be hanged."
"Do you think the king will be pleased with me for bringing it?" asked Bellyn.
"Pleased!" said Reynard. "Why, pleased isn't the word. Only you must make haste and not delay on the road."
I'm gone," said Bellyn, and off he went. there and then. with a clumsy trot, the bag swinging from his neck.
Shortly after noon the same day he arrived at court, and you can imagine how surprised everybody was to see him back again.
"Why, Bellyn!" cried the king. "What brings you here? I thought you were miles away on your path to Rome. And where are Cuwaert and Reynard? And what is that bag that is hanging round your neck?"
Then the ram told the king everything that had happened, and at the end of the tale handed up the small bag, so that the king might break the seal himself and take out Reynard's letter.
But the king would not to do. "I am not good at my letters," said he. "Here, Tybert, you are good at languages! Untie me this bag and read this precious letter."
So Tybert the Cat took the bag, untied it carefully, and drew out the head of poor Cuwaert.
"See," he said, holding the head aloft. "Reynard's writing, truly! Are you satisfied, king?"
The king bowed his head in grief and sorrow. "I have been vain and foolish," he said, "and I am well punished for trusting the word of one who a hundred times was proved a liar and thief." Then, turning to the beasts that stood around his throne, he cried in a loud voice: "Is there none of you all, you who call yourselves my subjects and friends, who will rid me of this cruel monster?" But no one answered him.

Suddenly there came the sound of flying feet, and the crowd of beasts opened and stood aside. The newcomer was little Lapreel the Rabbit, who, panting and breathless, rushed up and threw himself at the king's feet. "Help, Your Majesty!" he gasped. "Give me justice,        I pray!"
"Who has wronged you?" asked the king and frowned; he thought he knew the answer before the rabbit spoke.
"It is that villain Reynard, my lord," panted Lapreel. "Oh, I am near to death."
"Tell your tale," said the king, "but waste no words."
"It is short enough," answered Lapreel. "As I was coming over the hill this morning, I passed by the gate of Reynard's castle. He was standing there, dressed in a long robe, his head cast down as though he were praying. I was near him before I knew, and my first thought was to run away, but seeing him so quiet and still, and having heard how his heart was changed, I took courage and made to pass him by, and as I went I spoke to him in a gentle voice and said," Good morning, Reynard."
"Instead of answering me, he raised his right foot and gave me such a kick between the eyes that I was well-nigh stunned, and fell to the ground. I did not quite lose my senses, however, and in a moment I was up again and running for my life. But I only escaped by the skin of my teeth, for as I sprang forward I felt his cruel claws in my side. See, king, my wounds, how they bleed! Of your might, give me justice against that cruel beast!"
Poor Lapreel stopped and stood trembling, and hardly had finished his story than there came a whirl of wings, and Corbant the Rook, his feathers all draggled and awry, flew down to the foot of the king's throne.
"I, too!" he cried. "I, too, claim justice against Reynard the Fox. This morning I set out with Sharpbeak, my wife, to ramble over the heath. We had not gone far before we came across Reynard. He lay stretched out on the ground as if he were dead. His tongue was lolling from his mouth; his limbs were stiff; no movement came from his body. We were sorry to see him in such a plight, and we walked round him several times to see if we could discover a sign of life, but he lay quite still. At last Sharpbeak put her ear close to his mouth to listen for his breath, and as she did so  snap! The cruel jaws snapped, and my poor wife was a headless corpse!
"How can I tell Your Majesty my feelings when I saw this dreadful scene! Would that I had died in her place. As it was, I was so stunned by the terrible sight that I had barely strength to fly to a neighbouring tree, where I remained while the fox made his terrible meal. He ate all of her, all of her, beak, bone, flesh and feathers, and all the time he gazed on me with a disgusting grin. At last he slunk off to his lair, and I made all haste to fly to Your Majesty to appeal for justice."
In silence the noble lion listened to the rook's tale, nor did he speak when the story was ended, but remained with downcast, gloomy gaze. Then the rook spoke again:.
"Why are you silent, king? If ever you would enjoy peace in this your realm you must destroy this evil beast. The blood of many innocent creatures cries out for vengeance. Will you listen to that cry?"
Then the king raised his head and spoke in a loud voice.
"I swear," said he, "by all I hold most dear  by my own crown, by my kingdom, yea, even by my life  that I will exact from this villain fox the utmost penalty for his crimes. I will take such a vengeance that the fame of it shall echo round the world, and evildoers in lands far away shall tremble. I have been over-merciful and perhaps a little foolish, but never again shall Reynard's lies pass for truth with me. Now I lay my commands on you all, high and low; steel your hearts to grim resolve. Set yourselves one task and one alone  to bring to judgment this creature who disturbs our peace; and never look back until that task is accomplished!"
Nobody heard this speech with greater pleasure than Isegrim the Wolf and Bruin the Bear, who had good cause to hate Reynard. But Grimbert the Badger raised his voice:.
"Surely, king," said he, "you would not order us to kill Reynard at sight. Villain he may be, but no matter how great his crimes he ought at least to have a fair trial before he is condemned to death. It would ill become you to sentence him without giving him a chance to say a word in his own defence!"
"A fig for trials!" growled Isegrim. Trials are all very well in their way, but we know what a trial means where Reynard is concerned. If he came here today, I well believe he could prove himself innocent of crime as a baby a day old; but he would be a villain none the less. A speedy end to him, I say, a speedy end and no talking; just a tree and a good strong rope!"
"And if you killed him," said Grimbert, "what would become of the treasure of Krekynpit, the treasure that he alone knows the secret of?"
The treasure of Krekynpit!" growled the wolf. "Treasure, indeed! a fine treasure that! It never existed outside his own evil mind. Fools were all of us who believed that lying tale!"
"At least let us send a messenger to Reynard to bid him attend the court and answer for his crimes," pleaded Grimbert.
"No!" thundered the king. "I will send no more envoys. My mind is made up. We will not give the fox the chance to deceive us again, but go to his castle and dig him out of it like a rat out of a hole; and then, as Isegrim says, a speedy end, with a high tree, and a stout cord about his villain neck."
At this a great cry arose from all the beasts that stood around the throne:.
"Death to the traitor! Lead on, king, and we will follow."

When Grimbert the Badger heard the king swear to take revenge on Reynard, he made up his mind to warn his uncle. Unnoticed by anybody he slunk to the edge of the crowd, and then, while all the beasts were still cheering the king's words, he set off running as fast as he could to the castle of the fox. Straight as the crow flies he went, over hill and dale, jumping streams and crashing through woods, until he came at last to Malpertuis.
The fox was standing at the gate. He looked very hale and healthy, and he had grown a good deal fatter. He was playing with a couple of young pigeons which he had just killed, and he looked up from them to grin at his nephew, who arrived panting and out of breath.
"Why, good morning, Grimbert," said Reynard, "am glad to see you. How are things going at court? You seem to have come in a great hurry; has anything important happened while I have been away? On my word, I live the life of a hermit here, and get no news at all."
"If it's news you want," said Grimbert, "I have plenty. But it's not good news, I'm sorry to say - Uncle! fly for your life! Do not waste a minute, for King Nobel has sworn that he will have your blood, and even now he may be marching against you!"
"Come, come!" said the fox, smiling, "surely there's no great hurry!"
"It is all very well to laugh," said Grimbert, "but I assure you things are very serious indeed this time. The king is going to bring an army to besiege your castle, and he will dig you out like a rat from its hole  those were his very words!"
"And why has the king made this sudden resolve?: asked Reynard.
"You should know that," answered Grimbert. What about Cuwaert's head that you sent to the king in a bag? And what about the treasure?"
The fox grinned.
"And even that is not all, for this morning who should come to court but little Lapreel the Rabbit, whining because you nearly made a meal of him. His tale made the king show his teeth, I can tell you! And hardly had he finished when Corbant the Rook flew down, looking for all the world as though he'd combed his feathers the wrong way, and cried out that you had eaten his wife!"
"So I had," grinned Reynard. "And she tasted very nice."
"There you go, laughing again!" said Grimbert. "But it's no laughing matter. The king is deadly angry. Reynard, I'm very much afraid your last hour is near!"
"Pouf!" said the fox. "A fig for your last hour! What, Grimbert, do you know me so little as to imagine that I cannot find a way to outwit the king this time as I did before? The court have sworn my death, have they? We'll see!.
"But come, Grimbert, don't pull such a long face! You must be very tired after your journey. Step inside with me, and my wife shall cook us these two plump pigeons that I caught this morning. Then, after dinner, we'll have a friendly talk, and I will tell you my plans."

Grimbert followed the fox into his underground lair, and paid his respects to Reynard's wife, who was there as usual with her cubs. She made him welcome and set about preparing the meal at once. Presently the pigeons were cooked to a turn, and the good wife set them on the table. "I'm sorry I've nothing better to offer you," said Reynard. "If I had known you were coming I would have prepared for you. Two pigeons won't go very far, I'm afraid, between a badger and a fox and his wife, to say nothing of four cubs, who shall have the bones if they're good. What do you think of my children, Grimbert? Aren't they fine youngsters? There's young Reynkin, now; I have great hopes of him. One day he'll grow up to be as cunning as his father, if not better! And as for Rosel, you just ought to see him at the game of snaring fowls  it's a sight for sore eyes, I promise you!"
"They are very fine children," answered Grimbert, with his mouth full. "I am proud to call them my cousins! Will you pass a bit more of that juicy wing, Reynard, dear?"

After the dinner was over the fox brought out a bottle of wine, and the two sat drinking together for some time. Master Reynard grew very merry and sang a song. It was a very long song, and I cannot remember all the verses of it, but this is how the first verse went:
"Ever since I was born,
I have felt bitter scorn.
For working, respectable people;
So with merry heart sing,
Here's a fig for the king;
I care nothing for law, crown or steeple."
"Now," said Reynard, when the song was finished, "it is time for us to talk business. I have quite made up my mind what to do. Tomorrow morning we will set out for the court together, you and I, and we will see what the king has in store for us!"


"Go to court?" stammered Grimbert. "Are you mad?'.
Not a bit!" said Reynard. "You leave everything to me, and do not worry. Let us go to bed now so as to get a good night's rest, and we will be afoot before dawn."
Very much troubled, poor Grimbert retired to rest. He tried to think how the fox meant to escape his just punishment, but thinking was not his strong point, and it only made his head ache and kept him awake for hours. As for the fox, he was snoring almost as soon as his head touched the pillow.
The next morning before dawn the fox arose and made a journey all through the castle. Truth to tell, in spite of the bold air he had put on when talking to Grimbert, he was more than a little troubled, and he wondered, as he passed through the rooms of his house, whether he would ever see any of them again.
His tour ended, he awoke Grimbert, and then went to say farewell to his wife. "Goodbye, wife," said he. "Look after the little ones, and don't worry about me. I hope to be back again very shortly, but even if I stay away a long time you must not feel alarmed - not even if you hear bad news. Just trust me to find a way out of this coil, as I have found a way out of others."
Then, in the grey dawn, the two set out across the heath towards' the king's court. And as they went, Reynard asked: "Tell me, Grimbert, did Isegrim the Wolf speak ill of me to the king?"
"Yes, indeed he did," answered Grimbert. "His voice was raised above all the others. A long cord and a short shrift would be your fate if he were allowed to have his way!"
"I know he hates me," said Reynard. Did I ever tell you the story of the red mare and her colt?"
"No," said Grimbert, "not that I remember."
"Well then, listen," said Reynard, "and you will understand why Isegrim is so bitter against me."
"One day, a long time ago, when Isegrim and I were good friends, we went out hunting together. On the way to the woods we crossed a field where a fine red mare was browsing along with her colt, a fine plump youngster.
"'Here, Reynard,' said Isegrim to me," go and ask the mare if she'll sell that colt. If so, I'll buy him.'.
"Well, I did not much like the task, but I was anxious to oblige Isegrim, so up I went to the mare and said," Excuse me, madam, but are you willing to sell your colt?"
"'Why, certainly,' answered she; 'it is quite the fashion among mares to sell their children.'.
"'And how much,' said I, 'are you asking for him?'
"'As for that," said the mare, 'if you will come behind me and lift my right hoof you will find the price written there in plain figures. It is our custom, you know.'.
"As she said this, she looked at me with such a wicked eye that I easily saw she was laying a trap for me. So I edged away quickly and went back to the wolf. "'Well?"' said Isegrim.
"'She'll sell,' said I.
"'Good!' said he. 'Now I shall get a good meal.'
"'And what about me?' I asked. 'I hope you will give me a share!'
"'Give you a share, indeed!' laughed Isegrim. 'That's a good joke if ever I heard one! Yes, my friend, you shall have the hair and the hide.' Then I understood what sort of a friend I had in Isegrim, but I did not let him see I was annoyed.
"'Well,' said I, 'the mare will sell, but I cannot tell what her price is, because it is written on her right hoof, and, alas! I never learned to read. I don't suppose you can read either, can you?'
""Can I not!' cried Isegrim. 'Why, I'm one of the most learned scholars in the realm. I'll soon find out what the price is; you watch me!'
"So up he marched to the mare, and went to lift her right hinder foot. But as soon as he came near the mare kicked out at him with all her might, and sent him flying across the road. Then she and her colt scampered away.
"I rushed up to where Isegrim lay, all battered and bleeding.
"'Well, Isegrim,' I asked, 'did you see the figures? How much did she want for the colt?" But he did not answer.
"Then I asked him again: 'Come, clever one, what was written on the hoof? Was it in verse or prose?' But still he did not answer. And so I told him that learned fools were often the biggest fools of all, and came away. And ever since then Isegrim has been my deadliest enemy".

Grimbert the Badger and Reynard the Fox talked together till at last they came to the court of the king.
All the beasts were gathered together round the king's throne, and there was silence as the fox passed by. But Reynard held his head high, and did not seem a bit ashamed, and when he stood in front of the king he fell down on his knees and said:.
"Sire, and lord, I pray for our old friendship's sake: Give ear to what I have to say in my defence."
The king frowned at him and answered nothing. So Reynard went on:.
"Dear lord, I have been told that my enemies have dared to slander me when I was not here. They have accused me of I know not what crimes. If I am guilty, let me be punished, but if you will listen to me, you may find I am not the villain you think. I am no flatterer when I say that you are just. Further, I can so explain my actions that you will grant that I am in the right." .
"Reynard," said the king, "a pot may go so often to the water that it is broken at last. You have deceived me many times, but I have sworn that you shall do so no more." .
At these words Reynard inwardly quaked with fear, but he gave no sign of it.
"Sire," he cried, "if I had known myself guilty, do you think I should have come here today to place myself in your power and in that of my foes? I was free to go where I liked, and had I chosen to escape I could have done so. But as soon as I heard of the tales that had been told about me, I hurried to court, and I would have been here sooner had I not gone some distance on my way to Rome."
"And Lapreel the Rabbit, whom you treated so vilely," said the king, "what have you to say about him?"
Why," answered Reynard, "here is the truth of that matter. Yesterday morning, as I stood at my door saying my morning prayers, the rabbit came by. "Good morning, dear Lapreel," I said. "Where are you going in such a hurry?"
"'Reynard,' he answered, 'have you by any chance a scrap of meat in the house? I am on my way to court, but I am so weak with hunger that I shall never reach there if I do not get some food quickly.'.
"'Why,' said I, 'come in, my dear friend. I have no meat at all, because, you know, I always fast on a Wednesday, but I have plenty of bread, and that you shall have, with some of the finest butter you ever tasted.".
"So Lapreel followed me into my home, and I set a good meal before him, and he ate till he could eat no more. Rosel, my little son, who had not yet had his breakfast, came to the table and took a piece of the bread that was left. Then, suddenly Lapreel hit him with all his force in the mouth, making him bleed badly. Seeing this, his brother Reynkin sprung upon the Rabbit and would have killed him if I had not torn him away. As a matter of fact, Lapreel has to thank me for saving his life, and yet he complains to the king that I tried to murder him!"
"Hum!" said King Nobel. "And Corbant the Rook  what of him?"
"It was the same day, my lord," answered Reynard. "Corbant the Rook came to me with his feathers all draggled, and he was crying bitterly.
"'Why, what is the matter with you?' I asked.
"'Alas!' he said. 'My poor wife is dead. She found a dead hare on the heath over there and ate some of the flesh. The hare had been dead a long time, and the flesh poisoned her.".
"Then I tried to comfort the poor fellow, but he would not listen to my words, and flew off to a high tree, and the next thing I hear is that he accuses me of killing his wife! How could I kill her when she has wings and I go afoot? How could I come near her? Now, king, if anyone should doubt my words I am willing to stand against them in fair fight!"
All the court was silent when they heard Reynard speak thus stoutly, but the king cried:.
You have heard what Reynard says. Come forth, you who accuse him, and speak before his face. Yesterday there were many who came to complain of him. Who will speak now that he is here?"
But no one answered, for all the beasts were afraid of Reynard's fierceness and cunning, and as for Lapreel the Rabbit and Corbant the Rook, they had long ago fled in fear.
Well, Reynard," said the king, "you may be right in what you say. It could be so, since none of your accusers come forward. But there is still one matter  the gravest of all that you have not explained. When you were here before and were condemned to die I listened to your pleadings and granted you mercy. I sent you to Rome that you might beg forgiveness of the pope, and at your own request I sent Bellyn the Ram and Cuwaert the Hare with you. Bellyn the Ram came back, but what of Cuwaert the hare? We saw him no more, only his head, that you sent here in the small bag I gave you to take to Rome! What have you to say to this?"
Then Reynard was very much afraid, and even his ready wit failed him for a time. He stood there confused and trembling, and the king's stern voice was raised again.
"You false villain!" cried he, and his eyes flashed with anger. "Why do you not speak? Are you struck dumb by the memory of your crimes?"
But Reynard still stood confused and trembling, and could not utter a word.

Now, among the beasts that stood around the king's throne was Dame Rukenaw, the wife of Martin the Ape. She was Reynard's aunt, and she stood high in favour with the queen. When she saw the turn things were taking she was sorry for Reynard and stood forward to say a word in his defence. She reminded the king of the fox's cunning and wisdom, and bade him remember how often he had done good service in days gone by.
"Do not judge hastily, my lord," said she. "Remember there are always two sides to a tale, and you have heard but one. The very fact that the fox cannot answer you is to me proof of his innocence, for everybody knows his ready wit. Had he expected to face this dreadful charge who can doubt but that he would have prepared a tale that would have explained everything away?.
"Moreover, my lord, the fox is just. Do you remember how he dealt with that case of the man and the serpent two years ago?.
"The serpent had been caught in a snare as he was gliding through a hedge.
"The noose was round his neck, and in spite of all his writhings he could not free himself.
"A man came by, and the serpent called out to him for help. The man was sorry for the serpent and was minded to release him, but being a prudent fellow, he said, "If I set you free, will you promise to do me no harm?" So the serpent promised, and the man set him free, and the two went on together.
"Now, the serpent was hungry, and before they had gone very far he sprang upon the man, and would have killed him. But the man leapt aside, and said, "What, have you forgotten the oath you swore, that you would do me no harm?"
"The serpent answered, 'Hunger can make a man break an oath.' So the man said, 'Give me at least a chance, and let us go on till we meet with someone who can judge between us.'.
"The serpent granted this, and they went on till they met the raven, who thought it right that the serpent should eat the man. The raven said this because he hoped to have a share also.
"But the man said, 'How shall a robber judge justly?'
And so they went on again till they met the wolf and the bear. The man and the serpent told their case to them, too, and both judged that the serpent was right in eating the man.
"Once again the serpent sprang on him, but once again the man leapt away.
"'My case is not fairly judged,' he said. 'Those who have spoken so far are themselves robbers and murderers. I appeal to the king!'
"So it was agreed, and they came to this court, and Your Majesty will remember that you were sorely puzzled, and could not give judgment, for you thought that, as the serpent said, hunger may cause a man to break an oath.
"Then came Reynard the Fox, and the case was told to him, because of his wisdom. And Reynard said:.
""This is a hard case, and I cannot judge unless I see exactly how the man found the serpent in the first place. Let me see the serpent in the hedge with the snare round his neck.".
So they took the serpent and put the noose round his neck as it was before.
Then Reynard called the man, and said: ' Was it just like this that you found him?" And the man said it was so.
""Then," said Reynard," begin the matter all over again. Let the man, knowing what he knows, set the serpent free if he will, and if he does not care to let the serpent free, then the serpent's neck must remain in the noose!"
"That was the fox's judgment, king, and right well did you applaud it. Was that the judgment of a wicked man? I, myself, will stand for Reynard's honour, and I am not the only one. Stand forth, all of you who are of my kin and of Reynard's, and pray the king to have mercy on him."
Then a crowd of beasts stepped forward, headed by Grimbert the Badger, Reynard's nephew. And the king said, "It is well. I will give Reynard another chance and listen to what he has to say. Let him explain, if he can, how Cuwaert the Hare died."

All the time that Dame Rukenaw had been speaking Reynard had stood silent with bent head, like one confused. But when he heard the king's voice bidding him explain Cuwaert's death, he raised his head and said:.
"What is this you say of my poor friend Cuwaert? Twice have you told me that he is dead. Is it true, and shall I never see him again?"
The king looked at him sternly, but Reynard boldly met his gaze.
"You know it full well, Reynard," said King Nobel. "Did you not send Bellyn the Ram to me with Cuwaert's head in a bag?".
"I cannot understand," said Reynard, in a puzzled way. "Where, then, is Bellyn? I pledged my honour he should come safe to you."
"He came surely enough," said the king grimly, "but you will never see him again, for I condemned him to death as a traitor and a fool."
"But the jewels!" said Reynard wonderingly. "Did he bring the jewels safely to Your Majesty?"
The king picked up his ears. "What is that?" he asked. "The jewels? What jewels do you mean?"
"I gave him three jewels to carry to my lord," said Reynard, "three jewels worth a king's ransom. And for the better safety of them, because I knew Bellyn the Ram to be thick-witted at his best, I sealed them in the small bag Your Majesty gave me to bear with me to Rome."
By this time both the king and queen and most of the court also were all agog with excitement.
"I pray Your Majesty do not tell me my precious jewels are lost," cried Reynard pleadingly. "Oh, they were gems beyond compare. No others were there in the world like them for beauty or worth. Alas that I was born! Oh, poor me!"
"Come, come, Reynard!" said Dame Rukenaw. "Do not give way. You will not find your jewels again by crying about them. Describe them to us, and perhaps we shall find a way to win them back."
"They were for my gracious lord, the king," said Reynard in a broken voice, "for the king and his sweet spouse, my lady queen. They were a part of the treasure of Krekynpit, and I had kept them a long time hidden in a secret place in my castle. It was to get them that I broke my journey to Rome."
"What were they like?" cried the queen. "Tell me quickly, dear Reynard, I pray you. Were they of great worth?"
"Not all the treasure of this realm could buy them," answered Reynard,: for each jewel had magic powers of its own. Listen while I tell you what they were. The first was a ring made of fine gold. Inside it were engraved three words in a strange tongue, which I could not read. I showed them, however, to a wise man once, and he told me that whoever wore that ring should never come to harm by thunder or lightning, neither could heat burn, nor cold freeze him. On the top of the ring was set a gem coloured in three tints red, white and green. And the red part of the stone was a charm against darkness, so that the owner of the ring had but to touch it and his way was illumined on the blackest night. The white part of the stone was even more powerful, for if a man had any disease of his body he had but to touch the unhealthy part with this ring and he was made whole again. And the green part of the stone that was a potent charm in war-time, for the owner of the ring who bore it on his finger need never fear the thrust of the enemy's weapon. No spear could pierce, no arrow wound him; he was invincible in war."
"Ah, me," the king answered," that such a ring should be lost to me! Go on, dear Reynard. The second jewel  what was that?"
"A wonder, sire, that would have made the queen's heart glad. It was a comb of gold, fit to touch Her Majesty's beautiful hair as no other comb in the world may be! A comb of gold, most marvellously fashioned, with big teeth and small teeth. And on the back of it were histories  wonderfully carved tales of the heroes of old of Troy Town, and fair Helen, and Paris the false and fair. To think that such a gem of workmanship lost!"
The queen said, "Oh, Reynard, why did you entrust such a treasure to such a messenger?"
"How could I know?" answered Reynard. "And I have not told you all about that comb yet. For whoever used it, her tresses should never lose their youthful colour or turn grey with age."
"And the third treasure," broke in the king, "what about that?"
"That also was for the queen, Your Majesty," said Reynard. "It was a mirror of polished crystal glass. Whoever looked into that mirror could see what was done by man or beast a mile away, and if he had any disease of the eye he was at once cured of it. The frame was of ebony, wrought with gold and inset with jewels, and on it, too, were carved many wonderful histories.
"There was first the history of the horse and hart.
"The horse was in full chase after a hart, and the hart outran him, and the horse was angry. So, meeting a herdsman, the horse said to him," Leave your sheep and help me to catch this hart. When we have caught him I will give him to you, and you can sell his hide and horns!"
"'I should like it very well,' said the herdsman, 'but how are we to catch him?'
"'Jump on my back,' said the horse, 'and I will show you.'
"The herdsman took a rope for a bridle, and jumped on the horse's back, and they rode after the hart, but they could not catch him.
"At last the horse said, 'It is no use, he is too swift for us. Let me rest now, for I am indeed winded.'
"But the man said, 'I have a bridle in your mouth, and I am your master. I will subdue you, and from now on you shall carry me where I will, for it is better to ride than to walk.'
"So the horse was taken captive into slavery, and he has been a slave to man ever since.
"And there was graven on the mirror yet another tale of the donkey and the hound. Both lived with a certain rich man. Now the man loved his hound, and would often play with him, but he never played with the donkey, and when the donkey saw this he said to himself:.
"'I wonder what my master sees in this fool of a hound to make such a fuss about? I do more work in a day than he does in a year, yet he sits by him at table and feeds on the choicest foods, while I have nothing to eat but thistles and nettles, and no bed but the hard ground. I have seen him leap upon my master and lick his face. Perhaps that is why he is loved so dearly. I will do the same, and try to earn my master's love.".
"So the next time the man came in the donkey leapt upon him and grinned and brayed, and planted one of his hoofs in his master's ear, and the other one in his master's eye. And he tried to lick his face with his long tongue. "The man cried out in fear:.
"' Help! Help! This villain donkey will slay me. Come quickly!"
"So the servants came with thick cudgels and beat the poor donkey soundly. Sadly he went back to his stable and ate again of his nettles and thistles.
"And there is yet another story of my father and Tybert the Cat, which is written on the mirror.
"My father and Tybert were once great friends. They hunted together and swore never to part one from the other. And one day the huntsmen and the hounds came after them, and they had to fly for their lives.
"Do not fear, Tybert," said my father, as they sped along. "I have a sackful of tricks to play on these huntsmen. Trust to me.".
"Tybert was very much afraid, and he replied, 'Alas! I have but one trick, and I must trust to that.'
"So when the huntsmen came on, my father tried each of his tricks in turn, but nothing came of them. But the cat played his one trick with success, for he climbed a tree and hid among the leaves, and laughed at the huntsmen as they scurried by. My poor father doubled and turned, but it was no use. The cat cried out and mocked him, and said, 'Come, Reynard, untie your bag of tricks and let me see them.' My father only just managed to escape with his life by running into a hole, and ever since then I and my kin have hated Tybert the Cat.
"These and many more histories every whit as interesting were graven on that mirror. I intended it for you, Good Queen, and well would it have beguiled many an idle hour. Ah, woe is me that it is lost!"
"But did you give these treasures to Bellyn?" asked the king excitedly.
"Yes, to Bellyn, and sealed in a bag. With Bellyn I sent Cuwaert the Hare to run before and bring the news to Your Majesty of the coming of my gifts. Little did I think when I bade farewell to Cuwaert that the faithful creature was so near his death. I loved him best of all. Bellyn, too, was my friend, and both of them have come to their end through me. I cry for justice upon the murderer, O King. Perhaps he is here among us even now. If so, let him tremble, for though he place the world between us I will find him out and run him down. He was wily to kill the hare and fool poor Bellyn into taking his friend's head instead of the jewels to court, but his wile will be no match for mine. I will have vengeance, I swear it!"
Then all the court was silent, pondering this new tale that Reynard had told. But the king and queen could think of nothing but the jewels  the king of the ring that would give him power, and the queen of the comb and the mirror that would bring her beauty and pleasure.

Reynard saw that his tale of the three wonderful jewels had awakened interest in the minds of the king and the queen and was very glad, but he was far too cunning to show his pleasure. He kept still a stern, grave face, and after a little silence began to speak again. "Do you still doubt my faith, king?" he said. "Who among all your friends is there who would bring you such precious gifts? My wife wept when she saw me put the jewels in the bag to send to Your Majesty, for, woman-like, she treasured them exceedingly and especially the mirror. Well do I know who has poisoned your heart against me  it is that treacherous thief, Isegrim the Wolf, who has always hated me and would work my ruin if he could!"
Isegrim glared at Reynard and showed his teeth in a wicked snarl. If looks could kill, Reynard would have died that day. As it was, however, he took no notice of the wolf's scowls, and went on speaking.
"There was a time, Your Majesty, and not so very long ago, when you knew well how to judge between the wolf and me. Do you remember that day when the wolf and I were in the forest together? We had caught a pig, and were about to make our dinner from it when Your Majesty and Mylady Queen came out of a grove and prayed us to give you a part. You had been out hunting, and had caught nothing, and you were very hungry.
"How did I answer you? 'Yes, lord,' I said, 'with a good will.' But the wolf growled out sulkily like the ill-mannered cur that he is, and took a half of the pig for himself and left only a quarter each for you and the queen. Do you remember? And he gave me only the skinny part of the pig's tail for my dinner. And I was very hungry, lord. Bad luck to him for being such a greedy knave!.
"And what was half a pig between you and the queen? You remember how you ate it up quickly and asked for more, and when he neither gave nor offered you any you lifted up your right foot and kicked him till he howled for mercy. Then you said to him, "Make haste and bring us some more food, and we will see that the next meal is shared better.".
"I went with him, and it was not long before we killed a fat calf, and brought it back to you. Then you praised me, and said I was swift in hunting, and bade me deal out the meat. So I dealt it out, saying, 'One half the meat shall be for the king and the other half for the queen. Isegrim shall have the head and I will have the feet.".
"Then you said to me, 'Well done, Reynard! Who taught you to share so well?'
"And I answered, 'I learnt it from seeing the sores of Isegrim where you kicked him, my lord. I think his groans at night come from being knocked by Your Majesty.'
"Next you were well pleased and took me into favour, but you sent Isegrim about his business and would have nothing more to do with him. And you were wise in that. This was not the only time that I proved my worth to you in days gone by. I could recall many more things to your mind if it would not take too long. Now, alas, you have forsaken me, who was always your friend, and believe the lies my enemies tell of me."
Here Reynard broke down and sobbed, while large tears rolled down his cheeks.
"Come, Reynard," said the king kindly. "Do not give way. I am far from believing everything I hear, you know. As a matter of fact, now I come to think of it, all that I know of Cuwaert's death is the fact that Bellyn brought his head here in a bag. There is no proof that you had anything to do with the killing of him.

The wolf had been boiling with rage all the time that Reynard had been speaking, and could keep silence no longer.
"Do not be deceived, king," he burst out. "Every word this false fox utters is a lie. Listen while I tell you what he did to my poor wife.
"One cold winter's day, when food was hard to get, he met my wife in the forest, and asked her if she liked fish. She said she did. So Reynard told her that he would show her how she might catch plenty of them. 'All you have to do,' he said," is to go out into the middle of the river and make a hole in the ice. Then sit down over the hole and let your tail dangle in the water, and before long so many fish will bite at it that there will be enough and to spare for four people!'
"Well, my lord, my poor, trusting wife did as the villain told her. She made a hole in the ice, let her tail down in the water, and sat there for many hours. But she never caught any fish. Then, when she got tired of waiting and tried to get away, she found that her tail was frozen hard into the ice, and she could not move. She tugged and tugged, but it was all in vain, and every time she tugged it hurt her dreadfully, my lord! I heard her screaming, and came to her aid, and as soon as Reynard saw me he ran away, laughing. I got her out at last, but she had to leave the end of her tail behind, and the noise she made brought every man within a mile on our track. It was only by good luck that we escaped death. What has the villain to say to that?"
Reynard turned his eyes to heaven. "How they slander me!" he sighed. "Here is the truth of the matter. It is true that I taught the wolf's wife to catch fish with her tail, and a very good trick it is. But like her husband, she is eaten up with greediness, and though she caught many fish, she was not content and wanted more. So she stayed on the ice till her tail was frozen in. Can I be blamed for her foolishness?"
The wolf's wife, who had been listening, was so angry that she could hardly speak. "You are a false, ungrateful rogue, Reynard," said she. "This is how you repay me for saving your life! What about that time when I found you at the bottom of a well? You had fallen in, and you were seated in a bucket at the bottom to keep yourself out of the water, and whining for help. I heard your cries, and asked you how you came to be in such a plight.
"'I came down to look for fish,' you answered, 'and I have eaten so many that I am full to bursting. Now I am so heavy I cannot get up.'
"'How shall I help you?" I asked.
"Then you said, 'Get into the other bucket, Aunt, and come to me." And I got into the other bucket, and it fell quickly with my weight; and as I went down you came up, till I was at the bottom and you were at the top.
"Then you got out of the well and grinned down at me, and said, 'So the world wags, dear Aunt; one goes up and another goes down.' And with that you went away. As for me, I had to stay there till I was nearly dead with the cold. A man came at last and wound up the bucket, and pulled me out, and would have killed me; and although I escaped him, he gave me so many hard blows that I was sore for many a day."
The fox grinned slily when Dame Ersewin finished her tale. "Well, Aunt," he said, "I don't see what you have got to grumble about. Did I not teach you wisdom? It is true that you had some hard blows, but one must always suffer to be wise, and I had rather you had them than I. At any rate, you learnt not to believe everything that was told you."
The wolf's wife growled, and Isegrim spoke up again.
"See how he mocks at us again, my lord," he cried. "Many a time has he brought me into trouble. See, I have only one ear; the other was torn away by the she-ape, and all because of him. Ask him about it, and let him speak the truth for once in his life."
"I have nothing to hide," answered Reynard. "Here is the truth of that matter:.
"One day the wolf came to me and complained that he was very hungry, and begged me to find him some food. So we went off together in search of it, and travelled half the day, but found nothing. Then at last I spied a big hole in the bank, half hidden by branches, and heard a growling noise from within it.
"'Go in, Isegrim,' I said, 'and see if there is anything to eat in there.'.
"But he was trembling like a kitten, and said, 'I would not go in for the king's crown.'.
Then I, small and weak, crept into the hole to face the danger, while he, the great hulking coward, stayed outside in safety.
The hole was very dark, and it was full of the most horrible smell I have ever smelled. All the time I crept forward the fierce growling continued. I was a little afraid, but I kept on. At last I saw a great she-ape, as strong and ugly a beast as ever I set eyes on. Near her were three little apes, and they were uglier than their mother, but if anything could smell more horrible than she did it was those children of hers. I was almost overcome with the stench, but I spoke quite politely, and said," Good morning, dear aunt! How do you do, and your lovely children?".
"She was pleased at this and smiled at me with big teeth, my lord. 'Welcome, Reynard.' she answered. "Stay here awhile and teach my little ones some of your tricks.".
"But I told her I was in a hurry and could not stay just then; but that I would come again some other day. So then she took me to her larder, where she kept a good supply of meat of all kinds, and bade me eat my fill. And when I was satisfied she gave me a big piece to take home to my wife, and bade me a fair good day.
"When I came out of the cave I found Isegrim groaning with hunger. So I took pity on him, and gave him my piece of meat, and he gobbled it down in two mo'thfuls.
"'Where did you get it, Reynard?' he asked.
"'In the cave,' said I. 'A she-ape gave it to me, and she has plenty more. Go you in and get some. But be careful, and praise her children, for she loves them.".
"Then Isegrim crept into the hole. But when he smelt the smell of the cave and saw the ugliness of the little apes, he cried out,"Oh, go and drown them quickly. They make my hair stand on end. I came here for some meat, not to gaze upon such filthy brats!"
"When the she-ape heard this she was angry, and quite right, too. She sprang upon the wolf, and tore him with her claws, and bit off one of his ears. It serves him right, I say, for being such an ill-mannered cur."
At this the wolf fairly raved with fury.
"I will stand no more of it," he cried. "We will see who is the traitor. Here and now I challenge you to mortal combat. Let us prove by ordeal of battle which of us is worthy."

When Reynard heard the wolf challenge him to fight, he felt afraid. "He is ever so much stronger than I am," he thought. "I shall never be able to stand against him in open battle, and it does not seem to me as if my cunning will be of very much use."
To refuse the challenge, however, would, of course, be to turn the king against him, so he had no choice but to accept it with the best grace he could muster.
Then the king bade the two choose their attendants. Reynard chose Grimbert the Badger and the young ape Betelas, son of Dame Rukenaw. Isegrim chose Bruin the Bear and Tybert the Cat. The battle was fixed for the next day, and both sides went away at once to get ready.
That same evening Dame Rukenaw came to Reynard and asked him how he felt. He looked at her dolefully, and shook his head. "The wolf is very strong," said he.
"Come now," said Dame Rukenaw. "Keep up your heart. You are a long way from dead yet. I have made up my mind that you shall win tomorrow, and I am going to help you."
Then she took a razor and very carefully shaved every hair from off Reynard's body, till he stood so smooth and thin that his own mother would not have known him. This done, Dame Rukenaw brought a flask of oil and rubbed it over his body till he was as slippery as an eel.
"Now then," said she, "that is the beginning. You are a little harder to get hold of than you were before, my dear Reynard, and I am thinking that Isegrim is going to get the surprise of his life. Now listen carefully to what I am going to say.
"The wolf is stronger than you, and he knows it. If once you allow him to come to close grips with you, you are as good as dead. What you have to do is to keep at a distance at the very beginning. Pretend to run away, and when he runs after you flop dust in his eyes with your tail. But be very careful that he does not seize your tail with his teeth. Keep your ears down flat to your head so that his claws cannot get at them, and dance in and out and round and round so that he will tire himself trying to get at you. And now, my dear Reynard, you had better lie down and get some sleep, for you will need all your strength in the morning."
Reynard thanked his aunt and made himself a couch in some dry fern. Here he lay down and slept soundly.
Early the next morning Reynard's cousin, the otter, came and brought him a fine fat duck for his breakfast. Reynard ate it with a good appetite and washed it down with a draught of cold water from the stream. Then he set off for the place of battle.
A great space had been prepared in front of the king's throne. Roound about, in a ring, stood all the animals who had come to see the fight. When the king saw Reynard, all smooth and oily, he gave a great roar of laughter.
"Ho, ho! Reynard!" he said, "You are a wily fox if ever there was one. No doubt you know what you are doing, yet I swear by my head that I never in my life saw an uglier beast than you have made of yourself!"
Reynard said nothing, but he lifted the corner of his lips in a savage grin, and presently the wolf came out, and the King gave the signal for the battle to begin.
Isegrim wasted no time. With a savage growl he sprang forward at Reynard, trying to strike him with his fore-paws, but Reynard was too quick for him, and jumped aside. Again the wolf sprang, and this time Reynard turned and ran away as fast as he could with Isegrim after him. Round and round the combat arena they leaped, the wolf attacking and attacking. Now and again Reynard slackened pace and let the wolf come nearly up to him; but each time as Isegrim raised his paws to strike, Reynard struck his tail on the ground and raised such a cloud of dust and sand that before long his enemy was half-blinded.
At last the wolf had to stop to rub the dust out of his eyes, but no sooner had he done so than Reynard turned in a flash and bit him three times in the neck.
"Now," said Reynard, "you are at my mercy. Kneel down and crave my pardon, and I will spare your life."
For answer the wolf gave a roar of anger, and, lifting up his foot, struck Reynard such a terrible blow on his head that he fell stunned to the ground. It was only for a moment, however. Before Isegrim could follow up his advantage Reynard was on his feet again, and thanks to his slippery body, wriggled out of the wolf's grasp before he could do him any great harm.
So, for a long time the fight went on. Ten times the wolf managed to get the fox at close grips, but each time his teeth and claws slipped in Reynard's well-oiled body, and he could not deal him a serious wound. At last, as he was running round and round, Reynard's foot slipped, and, in a moment the wolf was on him, bearing him down with his weight.
Now all seemed ended to Reynard, and he felt the terror of death in his heart. He squirmed and wriggled like an eel, and, though he could not get away, he managed to turn on his back, and raising his hind leg, he scratched the wolf in the face with his sharp claws.
"You villain," howled the wolf. "You have put out my eye."
"All the better!" panted Reynard, "you will only have one to wink with in the future, and it will save you a lot ot trouble."
For answer the wolf redoubled his efforts to seize Reynard by the throat; but, what with the slippery body and the clawing hind-feet, he could not succeed.
"I have you now!" he kept on saying. "In a minute I shall kill you." And, indeed things looked very bad for poor Reynard, who, try as he might, could not get free. He put his wits to work while the struggle went on. The wolf managed to bite his head.
"Well, are you beaten?" he said.
"What's the use of my saying I am beaten if you are going to kill me?" asked Reynard. "If you were a knightly foe it would be different; you would know that it is a base thing to slay a vanquished enemy."
"I will kill you with as little pity as one shows to vermin," said the wolf grimly. "Do not think to play any more of your tricks on me I know you too well. You will never make a fool of me again!"
Now, it is unwise to make long speeches when one is fighting. Talk wastes the breath and takes up the attention. Just as the wolf said the last words Reynard saw his chance, and doubling forward swiftly, he fixed his teeth in the wolfs throat. Isegrim, already weak with loss of blood, and half dead with fatigue, fell back in a swoon, and the fox sprang free. For a moment he stood warily waiting, then, finding that his enemy did not rise, he seized him by the legs and dragged him round the combat arena in triumph, so that everybody could see that he was victor.
Now, what a cheer went up from all the animals who were watching. Reynard's friends shouted with delight, and even those who hated the fox cheered too, because they were afraid to be silent. But Isegrim 's brother ran to the king and begged him to stop the fight and save the wolf's life, and this the king did.
You are victor now, Reynard," he said, "victor in a fair-fought fight, and mercy well becomes a conqueror. I charge you, let the wolf go free."
So Bruin the Bear and Tybert the Cat came and bore the senseless form of Isegrim away on a litter. They took him to a secret place in the woods and dressed his hurts, and brought the cleverest doctor among all the animals to attend him. And it turned out after all that the wolf was not seriously wounded, although he was badly scratched and torn, and before long the doctor was able to send a messenger to his wife to say that he would live. Reynard, too, went away with Dame Rukenaw, who bathed his wounds and praised him for following her commands so well.
"It is a good thing for you that you had me on your side," said she, "else things would have gone ill with you today."
"I know it, Aunt," replied Reynard, "and I shall always be grateful."
The next day Reynard, followed by all his kith and kin, went to pay his homage to the king, and the lion smiled upon him and did him honour.
"Sir Reynard," he said, "you have borne yourself right nobly. I raise you to the office of a peer in my realm, and I am sure you will occupy it well. Now you are free to go where you will."
And Reynard answered: "King, I heed you above all others. Not for all its treasures would I be unfaithful to you."
A little while later, headed by a band of music, Reynard and all his friends made their way to his castle of Malpertuis, where he set a great feast for them that lasted many days. His wife was glad to see him, and she was proud of her husband, for his wit and cunning were greater than those of any other creature.

There were once three monkeys who were going for a voyage in a balloon in Monkeyland, far, far away and ever so long ago. The three were so much alike that it was impossible to tell one from the other, and each of them answered to the name of James. The old monkey who was in command in the balloon, decided that each should have a different name. The first was to be called James, the second Jemmy, and the third Little James.
So far so good. The three monkeys climbed into the balloon, the ground ropes were untied, and the voyage was begun. When they had reached a height of some hundreds of feet, the captain wished to give an order, so he called to the first monkey: "James!"
"Aye aye, sir," said all the three, running up to him.
"I called James," said the captain, looking from one to the other.
"Well, I am James," answered the first monkey.
"No, no. James is my name," said the second.
"And mine too," said the third.
"How can you be James if I am he?" cried the first angrily.
"I tell you James is my name!" cried the second.
"No, mine!"
And so the three monkeys began to quarrel and dispute. Words led to blows, and soon they were tumbling about all over the car of the balloon, biting, scratching, and pummelling while the captain sat in his chair and bawled to them to stop. Every minute it seemed as though the ballon car would overturn. The end of it was that Little James got pushed over the side. He turned a beautiful somersault, and fell down, down, down through the air, landing in a soft bed of mud. He sank into to so that only his face and the top of his head were visible.
"Help! help!" bawled Little James at the top of his voice.
Up ran a pair of monkeys from the neighbourhood and stood looking at him.
"He's in the mud, brother," said one.
"Up to his neck," said the other. And they both began to grin.
"Help!" cried Little James again, more faintly, for he was sinking deeper, and the mud was nearly at the level of his mouth. "Pull me out! Pull me out!"
"Ah, but how?" asked the first monkey, looking at him gravely.
"Wait a minute," cried the second, "I have an idea!" And he pulled out of his pocket a cord, made a loop in it and threw the loop toward Little James's head. After some tries he could tug on the cord .
"Hey!" cried the other monkey, running to help. "Pull, brother, pull, and we'll soon have him out!"
But the cord snapped suddenly, and the two monkeys tumbled head over heels. Never mind; they got another cord to repair the damage, and this time they succeeded in pulling Little James clear of the mud, but his trousers and boots were left in the mud. "Dear me!" said the first monkey, scratching his head. "This is very sad. The poor fellow has lost his shoes. What shall we do?"
"Let us make him some wooden clogs!" said the other.
So said, so done. They made him a beautiful pair of wooden clogs, and Little James hobbled home in them, but he was not used to wooden clogs at all. By the time he reached his house his feet felt so sore that he went straight to bed. But after a while in bed he sat up, thinking: "I would like to write down what happened."
So he sent for pen and paper and began to write. Before very long, however, he stopped and began to scratch his head, all perplexed. "Above all one must write the truth - if one can write, I mean!"
So he pondered and pondered and knit his little brows, but then he happened to look in the mirror by the bedsid, and saw a furrow on his forehead.
"This is not me!" he cried. "I don't have a wrinkle in my forehead. The other Jameses have tricked me!" Happy at having found out of things, he turned over on his side and slept until next morning and a new day. This all took place in Monkeyland, ever so long ago.

A shining angel once got the job of colouring the birds. When he finished his work, he began to scrape his palette and make ready to depart The feathers of the birds around glowed with many splendid colours, and some grey and black ones for contrast too. The crow's dark grey coat was not too bad to behold either. All the birds were proud of how well they looked, and strutted about here and there, gazing at their reflections in the water and calling on their neighbours to come and admire their feathers.
The little goldfinch was the only one who did not take part in the rejoicing. Somehow or other the angel had overlooked him. Now he remained uncoloured, a drab little creature in a grey dress among the gaily clothed throng. On seeing the angel was cleaning his palette to depart, the little bird stepped forward and said:
"Sir, won't you paint my feathers too, now that you have painted all the other feathers around? If you would, I may walk about unashamed. Otherwise, I have no beautiful song like the nightingale or the throstle, no grace of form such as the swallows either. It seems I can do nothing better than to be overlooked or hide among the leaves."
The angel saw he had overlooked the bird, and would gladly have painted him with glowing colours, but he had scraped his palette clean. Therefore he took up a brush and went from bird to bird and took from each a spot of colour and laid them the goldfinch with great skill. When he had finished, the tiny bird had brilliant colours he too, and took a place among the most beautiful of them all. You may see him any day you like, sitting on a thistle and chirping his hoorays.

The summer had been very hot. Not a drop of rain had fallen for many weeks, and there was drought in the valley where the animals lived. The streams had dried up and the springs had ceased to flow. The fox took up his pipe and went out to take a walk under the lime-trees to think things over. There he met the she-goat.
"Good morning," he said.
She answered: "Alas! I don't know what we are to do to get water. We have finished all the water we had in the barrel, and unless we can find some more very quickly I and my children will die of thirst."
The fox said: "And I am so dry that my tongue is sticking to the roof of my mouth. I cannot even smoke my pipe with pleasure. What do you say to searching for water together? Four eyes are better than two, any day in the week."
"Agreed," said the goat, and away they started together. For a long time they looked everywhere, but not a trace of water could they find. Then all of a sudden the goat gave a cry of joy. Running up to her, the fox saw that she had found a well and was standing on the brink of it, gazing at the cool water far below.
"Hurrah!" cried the fox.
The goat answered: "The water is far down. How are we to get at it!"
"Leave that to me," said the fox. "I know a thing about wells. What you have to do is to get into the bucket which is hanging by the rope and glide down as smoothly and as safely as you please. I'll go first, just to show you the way."
So the fox got into the bucket, and the weight of him made it go downward while the empty bucket at the other end of the rope rose to the top of the well. A minute afterwards he was at the bottom, leaning over the side of the pail and greedily lapping up the water. Nothing had ever tasted so delicious. He drank and drank until he could hold no more.
"Is it good?" cried the goat from above, dancing with impatience.
"It is like the purest nectar!" answered the fox. "Get into the bucket quickly and come down and join me."
So the goat stepped into the bucket, which at once began to go downward with her weight, while at the same time the bucket with the fox in it began to rise to the surface. The two met half-way.
"How is this?" asked the she-goat in surprise. "I thought you were going to wait for me!"
"Ah," answered the fox with a grin, "what do I care! Some go up and some go down. I hope you will enjoy your drink, Good-bye!"
And as soon as he got to the top he jumped out of the bucket and ran off.
The poor she-goat had to stay there at the bottom of the well until the farmer came and found her, half dead with cold. And when at last she was rescued she found that the farmer put her into the fold with his own sheep and goats. She was not free to go home to her kids.

A long time ago there lived in a farmyard a cock that was very proud of himself, for he was a plump and handsome bird. He often strutted through the yard, lifting his feet high as he walked, and nodding his head at each step. He had a great comb of coral-red, and blue-black feathers streaked with gold. They shone brightly when the sun flashed on him, It was a joy to see him. His twenty wives gazed at him yieldingly wherever he went and were quite content to let him hustle them about and gobble up all the fattest worms and the finest grains of corn.
The cock was proud of how he looked, but even prouder of his voice. He could crow a lot, and did so every morning when the first streak of dawn appeared in the sky. Then he would get down off his perch, raise himself on his toes, stretch out his neck, close his eyes and crow so loudly that he roused people in the farm and some neighbours too. He loved to do it, for it was his nature.
In the forest close to the farmyard there lived a fox who had often looked hungrily on the plump and large bird. His mouth watered when he thought of him. One day he hid himself among the bushes in the garden by the farmyard and waited patiently till the cock happened to stray that way, pecking here and pecking there, wandering through the gate into the garden, and coming to the bush that the fox lay behind. Then the bird caught sight of a black snout and cunning, watchful eyes, and with a squeak of alarm he jumped aside, just in time, and hopped onto the wall.
The fox rose to his feet. "Don't go away," he said in honeyed tones. "I simply had to hear you sing, and I know I am not liked around here. But there is no cock around your farm with such a good voice as you, and I don't believe the stories they tell about you."
"Just what stories?" said the cock at a safe distance and looked at the fox with his head on one side. "What do they say?"
"They tell me that you can only crow with your eyes open, "said the fox, "and that all you can muster with your eyes closed, is some feeble piping. But I don't believe them. They are merely jealous."
"I should think so," cried the cock, bristling with anger. "Just look here, I'll prove it to you! And he raised himself on his toes, stretched out his neck, closed his eyes, and was just about to crow when the fox sprang on him and caught him in his teeth.
The cock flapped his wings and struggled as the fox ran off with him. The hens ran about the yard clucking and squawking. The noise they made alarmed the farmer's wife, who was cooking in the kitchen. Out she came running, with the rolling-pin in her hand. When she saw the fox with the cock in his mouth, she gave chase, shrieking as she ran. The farm-hands tumbled out of barn and byre armed with pitch-forks, spades, and sticks. All the animals began to raise a clatter. The shouting of the men, the squealing of the pigs, the neighing of the horses, and the lowing of the cows added to the clucking of the hens and the old woman's screaming. It was quite a choir.
The cock said to the fox: "They will catch us in a minute, and we could both be killed by a single blow. Why don't you call out and tell them I came with you of my own accord?"
"A good idea," thought the fox. He opened his mouth to call out to his pursuers. By that he loosened his grip on the cock's neck. Then, with a squirm and a twist and a flutter of his wings, the bird wrenched himself free and flew up to the branches of a tree nearby. The fox could not reach him there.
The fox glanced over his shoulder at the farm people, who were getting dangerously near. "I would have done better to hold my tongue," he snarled.
"True," said the cock as he smoothed his ruffled feathers. "And I should have kept my eyes open."

One day the fox and the bear began to argue about which was the most cunning beast. The bear said that he thought foxes and bears took first place.
The fox said: "We are clever, you and I, but man is above us, he is more than a match for us. He walks on two legs instead of four; he can swim in the water without getting soaking wet; when he is cold he makes yellow flowers grow out of sticks to warm himself; and he can strike at an enemy a hundred yards away!"
"I don't believe it," answered the bear. "If such a creature exists, it is very strange that I have never seen him!"
"Maybe strange," grinned the fox, "but soon remedied. Would you like to see a man? Then come along with me."
He led the bear through the forest until they came to a road leading to a village. "Now, then," said he, "let us lie down in the ditch and watch the road, and we shall see what we shall see."
Soon a child from the village came along.
"Look! Look! whispered the bear. "An animal walking on two legs! Is this the creature we seek?"
"No," answered the fox, "but one of these days the child will become a man"
Shortly afterwards there came along an old woman, all bent and wrinkled.
"Is that one?" asked the bear.
"No," said the fox again, "but once on a time that was the mother of one!"
At last there came the sound of brisk footsteps on the road, and peeping out between the bushes the bear saw a tall soldier in a red coat marching towards them. He had a sword by his side and a musket over his shoulder.
"This must be the man," said the bear. "Ugh! What a strange creature! I don't believe he is cunning in the least!" But the fox did not answer, for at the first sight of the soldier he had fled into the forest.
"Well, well," muttered the bear, "I don't see anything to be afraid of here. Let us have a talk with this wonder!" And hoisting himself clumsily out of the ditch he lumbered along the road to meet the soldier.
"Now then, my fine fellow," he growled, "I have heard some wonderful stories about you. Tell me . . ."
But before he could get another word out of his mouth the soldier drew his sword and struck him such a shrewd blow that he cut off his ear.
"Wow!" cried the bear, "what's that for?" Tell me . . ." But then, seeing the gleaming steel flash once again, he turned tail and ran off as fast as he could go. Just as he reached the edge of the wood, he looked backward and saw the soldier raise his gun to his shoulder. There was a flash, a loud bang, and the bear felt a terrific blow against his side. He fell down, but fortunately for him the bullet had merely glanced off his hide, and he was not seriously hurt. Picking himself up, he lost no time in gaining shelter from the large trees. After some time he came limping painfully to the place where the fox was waiting for him.
"Well," said Reynard, "now you have seen a man. What do you think of him?"
Bruin answered sadly. "When I went up to speak to him, he tore a rib from his side and cut off my ear. Then I ran away, but before I could reach the trees he picked up a stick and pointed it at me. Then there came thunder and lightning, something that knocked me spinning! I don't want to see him again, for I am going to carry the marks of our first meeting to my dying day."
The fox grinned and said: "I told you he is more than a match for us!"

There was once a lad whose face was so badly pitted by the smallpox that everybody called him Sponsken, which means little Sponge. From the very day of his birth Sponsken had been a great cause of anxiety to his parents, and as he grew older he became more trouble still, for he was so full of whims and mischief that one never knew where one had him. He would not learn his lessons, nor work at any serious task for ten minutes on end. All he seemed to think of was cutting capers and playing practical jokes on people. At last, in despair, his parents told their trouble to the village sexton, who was a great friend of the family, and often came to smoke his pipe with Sponsken's father in the chimney corner.
"Don't worry, my friends," said the sexton. "I've seen young men like your son before, and they are quite easy to manage if one only goes about it the right way. Just leave him to me. What he wants is a good fright, and I'll make it my business to see that he gets it."
So far so good. Sponsken's parents were only too glad to fall in with any plan which seemed likely to reform their unruly son, so the sexton went off to make his arrangements. That night he whitened his face with flour, covered himself in a white sheet, and hid behind a tree on a road along which he knew Sponsken would have to pass.
It was the dark of the moon, and the place the sexton had chosen was very lonely. For a long time he waited; then, hearing Sponsken coming along whistling a merry tune, he sprang out suddenly from behind his tree and waved his arms in a terrifying manner.
"Hallo!" said Sponsken. "Who are you?"
The sexton uttered a hollow groan.
"What's the matter?" said the boy. "Are you ill? If you can't speak, get out of my way, for I am in a hurry."
The sexton groaned again, louder than before, and waved his arms wildly.
"Come, come," cried Sponsken, "I can't stay here all night. Tell me what you want at once and let me pass." Then, as the ghostly figure made no answer, he struck it a blow with the stout ash-stick which he carried, and the poor sexton fell, stunned, to the ground. Sponsken stayed long enough to take a glimpse of the ghost's face and to recognize the features of the sexton beneath the flour; then he went on his way homeward, whistling as merrily as before.
When he reached home his parents gazed at him uneasily. They were very anxious about the success of their friend's plan, but Sponsken did not look at all like a lad who had been frightened quite the contrary in fact, for he drew his chair up to the table and set to work upon his supper with an excellent appetite.
"A funny thing happened to me tonight," he said carelessly between two bites of an onion. "As I was walking along the lonely road by the cemetery a white figure jumped out at me."
"A wh-white figure!" stammered his father. "How terrifying! And what did you do, son?"
"Do?" said Sponsken cheerfully. "Why, I fetched him a crack on the skull with my staff. He went down like a ninepin, and I warrant he won't try to frighten travellers again!"
"Base, ungrateful boy!" cried his father, rising to his feet. "It was my dear friend Jan the sexton you struck. All I hope is that you have not killed him."
"Well, if I have, it is his own fault," answered Sponsken. "He should not play tricks on me." But his father continued to rage and grumble so long that Sponsken got tired of hearing him at last, and flung off to bed in a sulk.
"I'll stand no more of this," he said to himself. "Since my own people do not appreciate me, I'll go out and seek my own fortune in the world, and they may go on as best they can."
The next morning, therefore, having packed a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese in a bag, Sponsken set off on his travels, telling nobody where he was going, and taking nothing else with him except a sparrow which he had tamed and kept since it was a fledgling. After walking for a long time he came to a forest, and feeling rather tired he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree to rest.
Now in this forest lived a giant who was the most hideous creature one could possibly imagine. From his forehead jutted a pair of horns; his features were more like those of a beast than a man, and his finger-nails grew long and curved like the claws of a wild animal. The giant considered himself lord of the whole wood, and was very jealous lest anybody should enter his domain. When, therefore, he saw Sponsken he was very angry, and having pulled up a young tree by the roots to serve him as a club, he approached the young man, who was sitting with his eyes closed, and struck him a heavy blow on the shoulder.
In spite of appearances, Sponsken was not asleep; he was far too wary a person to be caught napping under such conditions. As a matter of fact, he had seen the giant before the giant saw him, and he knew that his only chance of escape was to remain unperturbed and calm. When, therefore, the giant struck him on the shoulder, he opened his eyes sleepily, rubbed the place, and said with a yawn: "A pest on these flies! They bite so hard that a fellow can't sleep for them."
"You shall sleep soundly enough in a minute!" muttered the giant, who was enraged at Sponsken's nonchalance. "See how you like this!" And he gave the lad a blow on the other shoulder, harder than before.
"There they are again!" cried Sponsken, rubbing the place. "My word! They bite even harder on this side than on the other. It is time I was going!" And he rose from his seat, starting back with surprise as he affected to see the giant for the first time.
"So it's you, is it?" he cried. "What do you mean by tickling me when I am trying to sleep?"If I were not so kind-hearted I'd break your neck for you!"
"Take care what you say," cried the giant. "Do you know that I have the strength of twenty men and could crush you between my hands like a kitten?"
"Pooh!" said Sponsken. "Words are windy things. I have no doubt you could kill a whole regiment with your breath. But words won't go with me, my man; you must give me some proof of your prowess."
"Proof!" roared the giant. "See here! I can throw a stone so high into the air that it will not come down for a quarter of an hour." And he was as good as his word, for, picking up a large stone, he flung it with all his strength, and it was more than a quarter of an hour before it fell again at their feet.
"Can you match that?" asked the giant with a grin.
"Easily," said Sponsken. "I will throw a stone so high that it will not come down today! Bending to the ground he picked up a pebble and showed it to the giant, but very cleverly he managed at the last moment to exchange it for the sparrow which he carried in his pocket, and this he was able to do because the giant was rather short-sighted, and, if truth be told, slow-witted as well.
"One, two, three!" cried Sponsken, and he tossed the bird into the air, and it flew up and up and away and did not come back that day.
"Well, well," said the giant, "I never saw such a thing as that in my life before. You are certainly a wonderful stone-thrower, little man. But can you do this?" And picking up another stone, he squeezed it so hard between his immense fists that he crushed it into a fine powder.
"Yes, that is hard to do," said Sponsken, "but I think I can go one better. Any oaf, if he be strong enough, can crush a stone to powder, but it requires skill as well as strength to wring the juice out of one. Watch me!" So saying, Sponsken adroitly slipped out his piece of cheese, and squeezed it until the whey dripped from between his fingers.
"Marvellous!" said the giant. "I confess myself beaten. Let us go into partnership, for there cannot be two others like us in the whole world."
"Willingly," answered Sponsken, "but what are we to do?"
"Why, as for that," said the giant, "the king of this country has promised his daughter's hand in marriage, and a great treasure besides, to anybody who can destroy three ferocious beasts that are devastating his realm. It seems to me that this is a task we can quite well do together. You, with your quickness and skill, can trap the beasts, and I can kill them with my club. That done, we will divide the spoils."
So it was agreed, and without wasting a moment the two left the wood together. Before very long they reached the king's palace, and sent up a message by one of the lords in waiting that they would like to see His Majesty.
"And do you mean to tell me," asked the king, when he had heard the giant's tale, "that you can overcome the three fierce animals by the help of this ugly little pock-marked fellow."
"Hush! Not so loud, for the love of heaven!" whispered the giant. "My friend is very touchy about his appearance, and if he hears you making such slighting remarks it is very likely he will bring the whole of your palace down about your head!"
"You don't say so!" whispered the king in reply, glancing fearfully at the terrible little man. "Well, you are at liberty to try your luck. The three animals are a bear, a unicorn, and a wild boar, and at present they are hidden in the wood close by. There you will find them, but take care of yourselves, for they have already killed scores of my men."
"Don't be afraid," answered the giant, "for us this is as easy as playing a game."
After having partaken of a good meal the two made their way towards the wood in which the animals were hidden.
"We must make a plan," said Sponsken. "Listen to what I propose. You go into the middle of the wood while I remain here on the outskirts; then when you drive the beasts out I will see that they do not escape."
So it was arranged. The giant went forward into the wood, while Sponsken remained outside, waiting to see what would happen. He had not to wait long, for presently there was a crashing and a tearing of undergrowth and a great bear came lumbering towards him. Sponsken did not like the look of the creature at all, and decided to put as much space between them as possible. Looking here and there for a refuge, he spied a big oak-tree, and quickly climbed its trunk and ensconced himself among the branches. Unfortunately the bear had already seen him, and, raising himself on his hind legs with a dreadful roar, he rushed to the tree and began to climb. In another moment Sponsken would have been lost, but by good chance the tree happened to be hollow, so without hesitation the lad let himself down into the trunk, and finding at the bottom a small hole which led to the open air, he was just able to wriggle through it and escape. The bear followed him into the hollow trunk, but the hole at the bottom was too small for him to get out by, and as there was hardly room to move inside the trunk, the angry creature had to stay where he was, waking all the echoes in the forest with his growling.
he next minute the giant came running out of the forest. "Have you seen the bear?" he cried. "I drove him towards you!"
"Don't worry," answered Sponsken coolly. "I've shut him up in the tree there to keep him safe."
The giant rushed to the tree and dispatched the bear with one blow of his great club. Then, pulling out the carcass, he shouldered it, and the two went back to the palace, congratulating each other on the excellent beginning of their enterprise.
There remained now the unicorn and the wild boar. Next day Sponsken and the giant went to the forest again, and since their first plan had been so successful, it was arranged that they should follow exactly the same course. The giant went into the depths of the wood to find the unicorn and drive him out, while Sponsken remained on the borders to capture the animal when he came.

This time the period of waiting was longer, and Sponsken, leaning against the oak tree, had almost fallen asleep when a clattering of hoofs awakened him, and he sprang aside just in time to escape the unicorn, who, breathing fire from his nostrils, charged down upon him. So great was the impetus of the beast's charge that he could not stop himself, and with a mighty crash he ran full tilt into the tree, driving his horn so far into the trunk that, although he pulled and struggled, he could not wrench himself free.
When the giant came up, Sponsken showed him the animal, which was quickly killed with a single blow of the club.
"Didn't I manage that affair well?" asked Sponsken as they went back to the palace.
"You are a wonder!" answered the giant, and he really believed what he said.
Now only the wild boar remained, and on the following day the two went to the forest to capture him also. Once again the same plan was followed, but this time Sponsken kept his eyes wide open, and when the ferocious beast broke cover he ran as fast as he could in the direction of the royal chapel. The wild boar followed him, and a fearsome creature he looked, I assure you, with his wicked little eyes and his great curved tusks and the hair on his back bristling like the quills of a porcupine.
Through the open door of the chapel Sponsken ran, and the boar, snorting with fury, followed him. Then began a fine chase, round and round the aisles, over the pews, and in and out of the vestries. At last Sponsken seized a chair, and dashing it against a window broke several panes, and so made good his escape. While the boar was still standing stupidly staring at the hole through which he had gone out, Sponsken ran round to the door, which he closed and locked. Then, having broken one or two more panes of glass, he sat down quietly by the chapel wall and began to pare his nails.
A short time afterwards the giant came rushing up.
"Where is the boar? Have you let him get away?" he cried.
"Don't get so excited," answered Sponsken. "The boar is safe enough. He's in the chapel there. I had no other place to put him, so I put him in the chapel!"
"What a wonderful little man you are!" said the giant gleefully, and he ran off to kill the boar with one blow of his club. This done, he hoisted the carcass on to his shoulders and took the road to the palace. Halfway there the weight of the boar began to tell, for it was a massive beast, and the giant was forced to stay and rest.
"It is all very well," he said, mopping his streaming brow, "but I think you ought to take a turn with me in carrying this carcass."
"Not I," answered Sponsken. "We made an agreement that my work was done when I captured the beast, and I intend to keep to it."
So the giant had to struggle on as best he could for the rest of the way, grumbling at every step, while Sponsken followed, laughing up his sleeve, and exceedingly thankful that he had escaped the task.
When they reached the palace the two presented themselves before the king and claimed the promised reward. But now a difficulty arose. It was quite easy to divide the treasure, but which of them was to have the princess?
"I think it should be I," said the giant, "for I killed the three animals."
"Not at all," said Sponsken. "The princess should be given to me, for I captured the beasts."
"A lot of good your capturing them would have been if I had not killed them!" said the giant.
"How could you have killed them if I had not caught them first?" answered Sponsken. And so the two began to quarrel, and neither would give way, and high words passed between them. Truth to tell, the king was not at all sorry that the dispute had arisen, for he did not very much relish the idea of his daughter marrying either the bestial giant or the pock-marked, ugly little fellow who was his companion.
"There is only one way out of the difficulty," said the king at last. "We must let fate decide. Listen to the plan I propose. You shall both of you sleep in the princess's chamber tonight  the giant in a bed on one side of her couch, and Sponsken on the other. I also will remain in her chamber and watch her carefully. If she spends most of the night with her face turned towards Sponsken, it shall be a sign that she is to marry him; if, on the other hand, she favours the giant, he shall be her husband; but if she sleeps all night with her face towards neither of you, then you must both give her up, and be satisfied with the treasure."
So it was agreed, and that night the trial took place. Sponsken, however, did not by any means intend that blind chance should settle so important a matter, and he spent the intervening time in making certain preparations. First of all he went to the palace gardens, from which he gathered certain herbs having an aromatic and beautiful perfume; these he placed in a bag and hid under his clothes. Then from the woods he gathered all the herbs he could find which had a disagreeable smell, such as garlic and stinkwort and poisonous fungus; these also he placed in a bag, and seized an early opportunity, when they came to the princess's chamber, of hiding the bag under the pillow on which the giant's head was to rest.
The princess well knew the fateful issue which was to be decided in the night, and as she had firmly made up her mind not to marry either the one or the other of her suitors, she determined to remain awake all night and to take care to keep her face turned towards the ceiling. For a time she managed to do so, but before long drowsiness overcame her, and she slept. Presently she turned over on her left side and lay with her face turned towards the giant, who began to chuckle to himself.
"Wait a minute," thought Sponsken. "I don't think the princess will keep that position long!" And sure enough, the horrible stench of the herbs in the bag beneath the giant's pillow penetrated even to her dreams, and the princess turned over hurriedly on the other side. What a change was there! Instead of a disgusting smell which made her dream of gloomy caverns and noisome things, she found now a delicious perfume that brought pictures of sunlit gardens all glowing with flowers and bright-winged butterflies flitting over them. The princess gave a little sigh of content, and for the rest of the night she remained with her face turned towards Sponsken, so that the king had no choice but to declare the little man the winner.
The princess, however, refused to abide by the judgment. "I will not marry that vulgar fellow," she cried. "I will die first! Oh, father, if you love me, think of a means of escape!"
"Do not be afraid, my child," answered the king. "I will arrange something." And the next day he took the giant aside and proposed to him that he should rid him of Sponsken, promising a rich reward for the service. The giant's greed was aroused, and being very jealous of his companion's success, he was the more ready to fall in with the king's suggestion.
Fortunately for himself, Sponsken's quick wits made him suspicious. He guessed that some treachery was afoot, and in order to be prepared for emergencies he took a heavy hammer with him when he retired to bed at night. His suspicions were justified, for towards midnight the door of his room opened and the giant entered on tiptoe, carrying a heavy axe with which he intended to dispatch our friend. No sooner was his foot inside the door, however, than Sponsken jumped out of bed and sprang at him, looking so fierce that the giant, who was a coward at heart, and had besides a healthy respect for his companion's powers, turned and fled in dismay. Then Sponsken lifted his heavy hammer and struck three resounding blows upon the floor. The noise awoke everybody in the palace, and servants, guards, and lords in waiting came flocking to the room to discover the cause. The king came last of all, a little anxious about the success of his fine plot, and when he found Sponsken sitting up in bed, quite unharmed, his face fell.
"What is the matter?" he stammered.
"Matter?" answered Sponsken. "Nothing very much! Some person wandered into my room, so I just gave three taps with my fingers on the wall. It is lucky for you all that I did not strike the blows with my fist, for had I done so I am afraid there would have been nothing left of your palace but a heap of dust!"
At these words everybody turned pale, and the king made haste to protest his undying friendship for his terrible guest.
As for the giant, he was in such fear of encountering Sponsken's resentment that he fled, and nobody ever saw him again.
Now the poor king did not know what to do, for his daughter still persisted in her refusal to marry Sponsken, and he was torn two ways by love and fear. Just at that time, however, a neighbouring monarch, who was an old enemy of the king's, declared war on him, and this offered another opportunity for delay. Calling Sponsken before him, the king proposed that he should prove his valour by challenging the enemy king to mortal combat. Sponsken agreed; but his fame had already been noised abroad, and the challenge was refused.
"Very well," said the king, who was at the end of his resources. "As my prospective son-in-law you ought to lead my armies into battle. I will place my own charger at your disposal, and I look to you to save my country from defeat."
Here was a pretty kettle of fish! Sponsken had never ridden a horse in his life, and he had not the slightest knowledge of warfare. To make matters worse, the steed in question was a notoriously vicious brute who would allow nobody but his own master to mount him. Already he had accounted for several grooms and stablemen, whom he had kicked to death.
Sponsken commanded that the steed should be led to the borders of the forest and tied by the bridle to a tree. He had not the slightest intention of trying to mount the brute, and his plan was to wait until the attendants had gone away and then to slip off unobserved. Fate, however, was too much for him, for hardly was the horse safely tied up than couriers came spurring along the road to say that the enemy king was advancing at the head of his army, and was at that very moment less than half a mile away.
All the attendants fled at once, and Sponsken himself was so overcome by terror that, without thinking what he was doing, he jumped upon the back of the steed, and, forgetting that it was tied to the tree, dug his sharp spurs into its side. The horse plunged and reared, champing at the bit and doing its best to dislodge Sponsken from the saddle, but the lad clung on for dear life. At last, finding all its efforts unavailing, the horse dragged the tree up by the roots and charged forward in a straight line towards the advancing enemy. Almost dislodged from his seat by the sudden jerk, Sponsken stretched out his hand and grasped the branches of the tree, which swung in a terrifying manner at his side, promising every moment to hurl him from the saddle, and the result was that to the enemy army it appeared as though he were charging down upon them at full speed, bearing a tree as a club. Filled with dismay at the terrifying sight, the soldiers of the enemy king fled in all directions and hid themselves in the woods and in the crevices of the rocks. Sponsken rode on for the simple reason that he could do nothing else, right into the enemy's camp, where the steed came to a standstill and our hero was able to jump down from its back. Entering the king's tent, he helped himself to all the documents and articles of value he could find; then, having cut the tree from the bridle, he remounted the horse, which was now quite tame and docile, and rode back to the palace.
When the king heard that the enemy was routed he was overjoyed, and he recognized that a man who could perform such a feat single-handedly was not to be treated lightly. His daughter, however, was still firm in her refusal to marry Sponsken, and so the king made him an offer of half his kingdom if he would release him from his promise and allow the princess to go free.
Sponsken accepted his terms and married a girl who, although she was not a princess, was nevertheless very pretty. Their wedding was celebrated with great pomp and they lived together very happily for the rest of their lives.

A long time ago a cat caught a sparrow. After playing with it for a time, as cats will, he was going to eat it, when the sparrow spoke to him.
"The emperor's cat," said the sparrow, "and all his family, never begin a meal without washing themselves first. Everybody knows that such is the custom in polite society."
"Really," answered the cat, "well, I will do as the emperor's cat does!" And he let go the sparrow and began to wash his face. Feeling itself free, the sparrow flew away, and alighted safely on the branch of a tree well out of reach.
"It serves me right," muttered the cat, "for being so easily taken in."
And ever since that time cats have always washed themselves after their meals.

The miller of Sandhills had a donkey which had served him well in its time, but was now too old to work. The miller was a careful man, who did not believe in feeding useless mouths, so he decided that he would sell the donkey for the price of its skin. "I do not suppose I shall get very much for the wretched beast," he said, regarding poor Greyskin as he stood with hanging head in his stall, "but I shall save the cost of his corn anyhow, and that is always something."
Left alone, Greyskin reflected sadly upon the fate in store for him. "Such is the way of the world," he thought. "When I was young and hearty nothing was too good for me; now I'm old and useless I am to be cast out. But am I so useless after all? True, I can no longer pull a cart to market, but I have a magnificent voice still. There must be a place somewhere for one who can sing as beautifully as I. I'll go to the Cathedral of St Gudule, in Brussels, and offer myself as a chorister."
Greyskin lost no time in acting upon his resolve, but left his stable at once and set out on the road to Brussels, Passing the Burgomaster's house he saw an old hound sitting disconsolately on the doorstep.
"Hallo, friend!" said he. "What is the matter with you?"You seem very sad this morning."
"The matter is that I am tired of life," answered the dog.
"I'm getting old and stiff and I can no longer hunt hares for my master as I used to do. The result is that I am reckoned good for nothing and they grudge me every morsel of food I put into my mouth."
"Come, come, cheer up, my friend," said Greyskin. Never say die! I am in a similar case to yourself and have just left my master for precisely the same reason. My plan is to go to the Cathedral of St Gudule and offer my services to the master of the choir. If I may say so without conceit, I have a lovely voice one must make the most of one's gifts, you know, and I ought to be able to get well paid too."
"Well, if it comes to that," said the dog, "I can sing too. I sang a lovely song to the moon last night, and if you'll believe me, all the people in our street opened their windows to listen. I sang for quite an hour, and I'd have gone on longer if some malicious person, who was no doubt jealous, had not thrown an old boot at my head."
"Excellent," said Greyskin. "Come along with me. You shall sing tenor and I'll sing bass. We'll make a famous pair."
So the dog joined company with Greyskin, and they went on together towards Brussels. A little farther down the road they saw a cat sitting on the rubbish-heap outside a miserable hovel. The creature was half blind with age, and had a face as long as a fiddle.
"Why, what is the matter with you?" asked Greyskin, who had a tender heart.
"Matter enough," said the cat. "I've just been turned out of house and home, and all because I took a little piece of bacon from the larder. Upon my honour, it was no bigger than a baby's fist, but they made as much fuss as though it had been a whole gammon. I was beaten, and kicked out to starve. If I could catch mice as I used to do, it would not matter so much, but the mice are too quick for me nowadays. They laugh at me. Nothing remains for me but to die, and I hope it may be soon."
"Nonsense," said Greyskin. "You shall live to laugh at all your troubles. Come along with us and sing in the choir at St Gudule. Your voice is a little too thin for my own taste, but you'll make a very good soprano in a trio. What do you say?"
"You give me new hopes," answered the cat. "Of course I'll join you," and so the three went on together.
Towards nightfall they arrived at a farmyard, on the gate of which a cock was crowing lustily.
"Hallo!" said Greyskin. "What's all this about?"
"I am singing my last song on earth," said the cock. "An hour ago I sang a song, although it is not my usual custom to crow in the afternoon, and as I ended I heard the farmer's wife say: 'Listen to Chanticleer. He's crowing for fine weather tomorrow. I wonder if he'd crow so loudly if he knew that we had guests coming, and that he was going into the pot to make their soup!' She has a horrid laugh, that woman. I have always hated her!"
"And do you mean to tell me," said Greyskin, "that you are going to stay here quite contentedly till they come to wring your neck?
"What else can I do?" asked Chanticleer.
"Join us, and turn your talents to account. We are all beautiful singers and we are going to Brussels to offer ourselves as choristers at St Gudule. We were a trio before. With you we shall be a quartet, and that's one better!"
Chanticleer was only too glad to find a means of escape, so he willingly joined the party, and they once more took the road. A little while afterwards they came to a thick wood, which was the haunt of a notorious band of robbers. There they decided to rest for the night, so Greyskin and the dog lay down beneath the shelter of a large beech-tree, while the cat climbed on to one of the branches, and Chanticleer perched himself at the very top. From this lofty post he could see over the whole wood, and it was not long before he espied a light twinkling among the trees not far away.
"There must be a house of some sort over there," he said to his companions. "Shall we go and see? We may find something to eat."
"Or some straw to lie upon, at any rate," said Greyskin. "This damp ground gives me rheumatics in my old bones."
"I was just thinking the same thing," said the dog. "Let us go."
So the four choristers, led by the cock, walked in the direction from which the light came, and before long they found themselves in front of a little house. Its windows were brilliantly lighted. In order to reach to the windows the animals made a tower of their bodies, with Greyskin at the bottom and Chanticleer at the top.
Now this house was the abode of a band of robbers, who, at that very moment, were seated before a table laden with all kinds of food. There they sat and feasted, and poor Chanticleer's mouth watered as he watched them.
"Is there anybody inside?"asked the dog, who was impatient.
"Hush!" said Chanticleer. "Men! They're eating their dinner!"
"I wish I was," said the dog. "What are they eating?"
"All sorts of things sausage, and fish . . ," the Chanticleer began.
"Sausage!" said the dog.
"Fish!" said the cat.
"And ever so many other delicacies," Chanticleer went on. Look here, friends. Wouldn't it be a fine thing if we could get a share of their meal? I confess that my stomach aches with hunger."
"And mine too," said the dog. "I've never been so hungry in my life. But how are we to get the food?
Let us serenade them, and perhaps they'll throw us something as a reward," said Greyskin. "Music, you know, has charms to soothe the savage breast."
This seemed such a good idea that the choristers lost no time in acting on it. All four began to sing. The donkey hee-hawed, the dog howled, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed. From the noise they made one would have thought that the heavens were falling.
The effect of this marvellous quartet on the robbers was immediate. Leaping from their seats, they ran from place to place in mortal terror, tumbling over one another, oversetting chairs and adding to the racket by their shrieks and cries. At that moment the cock fell against the window, breaking the glass to smithereens; the donkey gave the frame a push, and all the four precipitated themselves into the room. This was the last straw; the robbers could stand no more; half mad with fear they rushed to the door and fled into the forest.
Then our four choristers drew up to the table and set to work on the food it was laden with. Their long walk had given them a good appetite, so that there was little left by the time they had finished. Feeling drowsy after their meal, they then settled themselves to sleep. The donkey made himself a bed on a heap of straw in the yard; the dog stretched himself out upon the mat by the house door; the cat lay among the warm cinders on the hearth; and the cock perched upon the roof-top. A few minutes more and they were all fast asleep.
Meanwhile the robbers, who had retreated some distance into the forest, waited anxiously for something dreadful to happen. An hour passed by and there was neither sight nor sound to alarm them, so they began to feel a little ashamed of their cowardice. Creeping stealthily nearer to the cottage, they saw that everything was still, and that no light was showing from the windows.
At last the robber chief sent his lieutenant to spy out the land, and this man, returning to the cottage without mishap, found his way into the kitchen and proceeded to light a candle. He had no matches, but he saw two sparks of fire among the cinders on the hearth, so he went forward to get a light from them.
Now this light came from the cat's eyes, and as soon as puss felt the robber touch her, she sprang up, snarling and spitting, and scratched his face. With a scream of terror, he dropped his candle and rushed for the door, and as he passed the dog bit him in the leg. By this time the noise had awakened Greyskin, who got on his feet just as the man ran by, and helped him forward with a mighty kick, which sent him flying out into the roadway. Seeing this, the cock on the housetop spread his wings and crowed in triumph, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
I wish you could have seen how that robber ran! He ran so fast that he seemed like a fleeing hare. At last, panting for breath, he rejoined his comrades in the forest, who were eagerly awaiting his return.
"Well," cried the chief, "is the way clear? Can we go back?"
Not on any account," cried the robber. "There's a horrible witch in the kitchen. Directly I entered she sprang at me and tore my face with her long claws, calling out at the same time to her creatures to come and devour me. As I ran through the door one of them buried his fangs in my leg, and a little farther on, in the yard, a great black monster struck at me with an enormous club, giving me a blow that nearly broke my back-bone. On the roof a little demon with wings and eyes that shone like coals of fire cried, 'Stop him! Eat him! Stop him! Eat him!' You may guess that I did not wait for more. It is a miracle that I have escaped with my life!"
When they heard this terrible story the robbers lost no time in decamping, and such was their terror that they deserted the forest altogether and went away to another part of the country. The result was that our four friends were left to dwell in the cottage, where they lived happily for the rest of their lives, and as they had now everything they wanted, they quite gave up their idea of going to St Gudule.

There once was a poor farmer. He earned a living by gathering dead wood in the forest, and he had a donkey as big as himself to carry it. Perhaps by this you will be able to recognise him.
One day the farmer hitched his donkey into the shafts of his little cart and went off as usual to the wood for his day's toil. Arrived there, he tied the donkey to a tree and then, by way of the cart, climbed the trunk in order to break off some dead branches that he had noticed above. As he sat there, legs astraddle on the branch, busily breaking away the dead wood, along through the forest came a lord dressed in fine clothes, with his manservant behind him.
"Hallo, my man!" cried the lord, "if you don't come down from that tree rather soon, you'll get a tumble. The branch you are sitting on is cracked."
"Cracked, is it?" answered the farmer. "Well, so much the worse for me." And he went on calmly with his work.
The lord went away shrugging his shoulders at the farmer's stupidity. And sure enough, before he had gone very far, crack! crack! the branch broke, and down fell the farmer to the foot of the tree. The fall gave him a fine blow on the nose, which at once swelled almost to the size of a turnip.
"My word," muttered the farmer, tenderly feeling the sore place, "that man must have been a sorcerer! He can foretell the future! He said I'd fall and I certainly have fallen! I must run after him and ask him to tell me something else. This is a chance not to be missed!"
So off he ran as fast as his bruised limbs would allow, in pursuit of the lord, and after a while came up to him. "Hi, sir, wait a minute!" he cried. "You told me the truth about the tree. The branch broke right enough and I fell on my nose. Won't you tell me something else?"
"Willingly," answered the lord, "and I hope this time that you will heed what I say. Take care not to load your donkey too heavily, for if you do so he will bray, and if he brays three times in I predict that you will die."
To himself and his servant the lord muttered in a low voice: "Some time."
The farmer did not hear that. "Oh dear me!" sighed the farmer. "Each prediction about my future seems to be unhappy. Nevertheless, I am very much obliged to you, sir. Thank you and good day." And he took off his cap and bowed to the lord, and lurched off back to his tree.
For a long time he worked busily and found so much wood that his little cart soon became full. Then he remembered what the lord had told him about loading his donkey too heavily, but he was so avaricious that he could not make up his mind to stop. "One more branch won't make any difference," he kept on saying as he piled more and more wood into the cart. At last the poor donkey could stand no more and, lifting his head, he uttered a loud "Hee haw!"
At this the farmer turned pale with fright. "Stop, stop! What are you doing?" he cried. "Oh, my dear little ass, I beg you not to bray again. I will not put another branch into the cart. We will go home straight away and you shall have carrots for supper!"
So saying, he climbed to his seat and shook the reins as a signal for departure. The donkey pulled and pulled, but the cart would not move an inch, although he strained his muscles to the utmost. Finding all his efforts vain, the donkey turned his head and once again brayed loudly in protest.
"Oh, dear me, that's twice!" cried the farmer, jumping down from his perch. "If he brays one more time I'm a dead man. Do you hear that, little ass? For goodness sake, keep silent until we reach home! I'll help you pull the cart!"
Freed of the farmer's weight, the load for a time was easier to pull, but at the end of another ten minutes the weight began to tell again. The donkey stopped and brayed loudly for the third time.
"That's finished it!" cried the farmer. "I am dead!" And he fell flat to the ground.
Left to himself, the donkey wandered slowly on, dragging the load behind him. Soon he came to the gates of the town, where the guard took him and put him into the enclosure. After a time, as nobody claimed him, he was sold.
Meanwhile the farmer lay where he had fallen. After some time a carriage drove up, and the coachman was forced to pull in his horses because of the body that lay stretched across the road.
"Come," he cried, thinking that the farmer was drunk, "rouse yourself! Get up, unless you want to be run over!"
"I can't get up!" moaned the farmer.
"Why not?"
"Because I'm dead!"
"Dead, are you?" cried the coachman, jumping from his seat in anger. "Well I've something here that will bring you to life again!" And he took his whip and - in less than ten seconds the farmer was dancing and prancing about all over the road.
Having thus effectively brought the dead man to life, he remounted his box and drove off grumbling.
In the roadway the farmer continued to dance about until he felt less pain after the whipping he had got. Then he looked around, and for the first time missed his donkey.
"Dear, dear, dear! he cried, one trouble after another! When I was dead I wished I was alive; now I'm alive I wish I was dead again, for I'm sore all over, and I've lost my ass. Whatever shall I do?"
Groaning and grumbling, he set off along the road in search of his animal. After a time he came to the gates of the town, where a sentry was standing with his long spear on his shoulder. "Good morning, good man," said the farmer. "Have you seen my little ass?"
"Your ass!" answered the sentry, smiling, and played a joke on him: "The only ass that has passed through these gates today has already become mayor!"*
"What? Mayor!" cried the farmer. "My ass? Tell me quickly where the mayor lives. I must go to him at once!"
The amused sentry now pointed out the way to the mayor's house, and the farmer hastened to the place. Arrived at the door, he sounded the great bell - Darlindindin! - and a maidservant appeared.
"Is the mayor at home?" asked the farmer.
Yes, he was at home, and the maidservant led the farmer to the room where he sat behind a big table loaded with documents.
"Good morning, ass!" said the farmer, with a grin of delight that twisted his swollen and discoloured features.
"Eh! what, what!" stammered the mayor, turning purple with anger.
"I beg your pardon," said the farmer, "I should have said, "Good morning, Mr. Ass," for you have become a great man now, while I am still a poor woodcutter. I don't envy you your good fortune, I am sure, although your promotion has left me without a donkey. Since you have become such a great lord, won't you give me back the ten florins you cost me, so that I may buy another?"
At this the mayor's exploded in rage. Leaping over the table with one bound, he seized the hapless farmer by the collar of his coat, threw open the door, and, with one mighty kick sent him sprawling from top to bottom of the stairs.

At one time the birds decided to have a king. It was the eagle's idea: he thought of it one day when he was standing on the lofty crag by his nest, gazing out on the plain below, and saw the kingly lion beside a dried-up stream. "Earth-bound creature!" thought the eagle. "Who are you to reign over us who cleave the air with wings and fly a long way too! He who is lordliest among the birds should rule the birds, and I am he!"
So thinking, the eagle spread his wings and soared high into the air and soon sent messengers near and far to gather all the birds so that he might tell them what he had come up with.
The birds came to answer the summons. The sky was dark with them, so dark that the animals on the earth below feared a dreadful storm was coming, and took shelter in their caves and holes. From north, south, east, and west birds came; over mountains, valleys, and plains; birds of all sorts and sizes, from the little humming-bird to the condor and the vulture. The ostrich left the burning plains where he loves to roam, and raced to the meeting-place. The seabirds and penguins all came, and the other birds between north and south. All the sorts cried in their own way, even with dialects, so there was plenty of calling, crowing, cooing, screaming, whistling, warbling, chirping and chattering. The air was filled with the sound of the birds a long way off.
When all the birds were gathered the eagle spoke: "Listen," said he, "I have called you together so that we may choose a king, such as the four-legged animals have. So it seems to me that the kingly crown should be given to the one among us who is fit for ruling all of us. What do you say? Shall we test this matter and let him who can come nearest to the sun be king?"
The result of the speech was that one bird spoke against another, disagreeing about the test.
"What is flight compared to song?" asked the nightingale. "Let the sweetest singer among us reign."
The canary and the song thrush and the blackcap all agreed with the nightingale, but they were shouted down.
"Beauty, beauty!" cried the peacock. "That is the test! A king should wear resplendent robes!" He spread his gorgeous tail.
"There speaks wisdom," gobbled the turkey, turning red in the face, and strutting up and down. "What do you say, brother," he asked a colourful cock. "Shall we arrange it so?"
"Bright feathers are only surface stuff!" cackled the ostrich. "Is our king only to be looked at, or is he to do nothing all day but chirp and twitter foolish songs? As for flying, I found my wings of so little use that I gave up using them long ago. My idea is that we should settle this matter by a running race!"
And so the birds went on quarrelling and disputing until at last the eagle called for silence, and, addressing the company again insisted on his own plan. He spoke sternly, and as all the birds went in fear of his curved beak and sharp talons, there were no more objections to it.
It was agreed that the trial should take place at once, and the cock was chosen to give the signal for the start. Very proud of the honour, he stationed himself on a little grassy knoll, and having ascertained that everybody was ready, gave a loud and clarion call. "Up, up we go," he cried.
There was the sound as of a rushing mighty wind as all the birds sprang into the air. Only the eagle remained in his place, looking after the others a little contemptuously. He thought he could surpass them all, and allowed them at least a five minutes' start. Then, leisurely, he spread his wings and soared.
Up, up, up he went; he overtook the stragglers on the fringe of the crowd, passed through the thickest press, and outdistanced the foremost flyer of them all  a goose. Still up and up he soared, until the birds flying far below were hidden by the clouds. Then he hung for a moment, motionless on extended wings, for he was a little wearied by his efforts.
All of a sudden he heard above his head, a tiny twit, twit, twit, and looking up, saw, to his surprise, the golden-crested wren, one of the smallest of the birds, flying merrily above him.
"I have outdistanced you. I am king! I am king!" cried the wren in joy.
"We will see," said the eagle grimly, "It isn't over yet," and once again he beat his mighty wings and soared.
At the end of a further five minutes, he stopped again, only to hear, as before, the wren's cheerful twitter above him. Again and again the same thing happened. Try as he might, the eagle could not outdistance the tiny bird, and at last, worn out with his exertions, he had to give up the contest, and glide down to the earth again. He was crestfallen.
The little wren had defeated the mighty eagle by a trick! When the eagle started on its flight the wren was safely perched on his back. There he clung until the eagle stopped rising, when it was an easy matter for the wren to rise from the eagle back and fly a yard or two higher, time after time until the great bird was exhausted.
Nobody suspected the trick that the wren had played, but the other birds were very indignant when they heard the wren declare that he had won the contest. "You, king!" they cried. "A tiny bird like you! It would be a disgrace to us. We would rather be ruled by the cackling and high-flying goose or vigilant eagle! Away with you before we tear you to pieces!"
The wren was as perky as you please, and for only answer he flew to the boughs of a tree, from where he looked down on them all with his head on one side, chirping, "I am king! I am king. Bow down and pay respect!"
A great cry of anger arose. "Kill him! Kill him!" screamed the hawk. Tear him to pieces!"
"You will have to catch me first!" twittered the wren, and as the hawk made a rush at him, he popped into a hole in the trunk of a tree - a hole so small that nobody could get at him. From the shelter of that safe retreat he kept on gibing at the birds, issuing commands and asserting that he was their king.
What was to be done? Nobody could get at the wren, and yet all the birds felt that he should be punished for his impudence. They consulted with each other, and it was decided to set the owl as a guard at the mouth of the wren's hole.
"Sooner or later," said the eagle, "he will have to come out in order to get food, and then we will have him. If, however, he chooses to stay where he is, let him; either way our purpose will be served."
So the owl mounted guard by the hole in the trunk of the tree, and having given him the most careful instructions not on any account to let the wren escape, the other birds flew away. All that day the owl remained vigilant at his post, and though the wren put his head out of the hole a hundred times, he always found his guard keeping careful watch.
Night fell, and a great silence fell on the woods, but still the owl kept awake for hour after hour, watching with unwinking eyes. At last, towards morning, his vigilance relaxed a little. His head sank forward on his breast; and he fell fast asleep. Hardly had his eyes closed than, rip! the wren darted out of his hole, and the next moment he had vanished among the trees.
When the birds returned the next morning they were furious to find that their prisoner had escaped.
"Unfaithful servant," they cried to the owl, "you have betrayed your trust!" And they fell on the owl to put him to death. With some difficulty he managed to escape, but ever since that time the birds chase the owl wherever they see him, for they are still angry with him. To keep out of their way he has to hide during the day and venture out only at night, when all the other birds are fast asleep.
As for the golden-crested wren, he is known as the kinglet, or little king, to this day.

There was once a man named Jaco Peter. He was so poor that he had not two pennies to rub together. His clothes were rags, his boots were shocking, and his house was a miserable hovel hardly fit for a dog. The only friend poor Peter had in the world was a big, red fox that he called Reynard.
One day Peter was walking along the road. He was looking out for stray scraps of food which he could pick up for his dinner when he met Reynard. The fox was out to spy around a farmhouse where there were some fine, fat chickens.
"Peter," said Reynard, "you look miserable today! What is the matter?"
Peter said gloomily. "It is my bad luck. I have found nothing today but two cabbage-stalks and a half-gnawed bone, and the bone has no marrow in it."
"Why do you eat such stuff?" asked Reynard disgustedly. "Look at me - I am just as poor as you, yet I live on the best that can be got! And how do I do it, Peter? Why, by using my wits! Cheer up, you may be a man of fortune yet, for I'll take your case in hand myself!"
Reynard stood by his word. The same day he called at the king's palace and asked if he might borrow a bushel measure. Such an unusual request from a fox caused some amazement- Servants went to tell the king himself about it. He sent for Reynard and asked him what he wanted with such a thing.
Reynard answered: "Jaco Peter might want to measure some money with it."
"Very well," said the king, "you may take the measure, but I would like to have it back when you have done with it, if you do not mind."
Off went Reynard with the bushel basket, and the same night, having stuck a couple of pennies to the bottom of it with a bit of grease, he sent it back with a message to say that he could need a larger one.
In reply, the king sent a two-bushel measure, and after a time Reynard sent this back also, asking politely for a larger one still.        "That friend of yours must be rich," said the king. "What did you say his name was? Lord Jaco Peter? I do not seem to remember a lord of that name in my dominions!"
"He is not one of those nobles," said Reynard glibly. "He will soon come to pay his respects to your Majesty, for he comes to ask for the hand of your daughter in marriage."
"That is a thing one must consider," answered the king, "but in the meantime I will gladly give your friend an audience."
Away went Reynard in high feather and recounted to Jaco Peter all that had happened. "Listen," said he, "you shall marry the princess and sit at the king's right hand!"
Peter looked down at his clothes with big and small holes in them, and made a grimace: "My toes are sticking out of my boots and there are holes in my breeches."
"Never mind about that," Reynard answered. "Just leave everything to me."
The next day, when the time came for the pair to set out for the palace, Reynard said to his friend: "Now listen well. Close by the king's palace there is a big muddy puddle in the middle of the road. When you come to that puddle I want you to trip over yourself and fall plump into it. Don't let there be any half measures! Get right into the mud wallow in it, and smear yourself from head to foot!"
"But why . . .?" asked Peter.
"Never mind about why. Do as I tell you!"
Poor Peter did all as the fox wanted him to do. When they reached the puddle he pretended to slip, and fell into it, covering himself with a thick layer of mud. At sight of the happening Reynard began to cry out in dismay, and the guards at the king's palace, who had seen the accident, came running up to offer their aid.
"Did you fall?" asked one of them politely.
Peter was wiping the mud out of his mouth and could not answer, but the fox cried: "Of course! Run to the palace quickly and borrow a change of clothes, for he is on his way to visit the king. What he needs is some robes worthy of a lord's great estate."
Away went the guards, and told the king's chamberlain about what had happened on the road outside the castle. A few minutes later they returned, bearing with them a magnificent robe of cloth-of-gold, beautifully embroidered and sewn with precious stones. Then they led Peter to a chamber, where he bathed himself and donned his new finery. Unfortunately the chamberlain had forgotten to send any shoes, so Peter's toes were sticking out of his boots under his magnificent gown.
"Never mind," said Reynard, "you must keep your feet out of sight under all those robes," and led him before the king, who was immensely taken with how Jaco Peter looked.
"Tell me," he said to Reynard after greetings had been exchanged, "why does your friend keep staring at his clothes. One would think he was not used to them!"
Reynard smiled. "As a matter of fact, your Majesty," he answered, "he is not. This dress of his came out of your Majesty's wardrobe, for he had the ill-fortune to spoil his own on the way here, falling into a puddle. The gown is good enough, as it goes, but my friend is used to something different. I would wager a thousand crowns he is thinking this very moment that he has never been clad in such a way before in his life! Is it not so?" he added, turning to Peter.
Peter gave a grin and a nod of the head, and the affair passed without further comment, but on their way in to dinner Reynard seized the opportunity to warn his friend against further faulty manners. But, as the saying goes, it is no use trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and no sooner were they seated at table, and Peter saw the magnificent golden dishes, the delicate cut glass, and the fine candle sticks, than he opened his eyes wide, and gave exclaimed in astonishment.
"What is the matter?" asked the king, staring at him.
"I crave your Majesty's pardon," said Reynard. My friend is a little overwhelmed, for your customs are new to him. In his own place, you see, he is used to other dishes. Come, come, sir," he added, clapping Peter on the shoulder, "it will do you good to live the simple life. Spartan fare, Spartan fare!"
Peter rolled his eyes and grinned again, before falling to, with a fairly good appetite, on the rich food spread before him.
"This lord must certainly be of rich," thought the king. "True, he has certain curious tricks of manner, such as supping his gravy with a table-knife, but what does a little thing like that matter! In other countries, other ways! That is a very good proverb."
After dinner was over Reynard broached the matter of Peter's marriage with the king's daughter, and the king said yes on her behalf. He begged Reynard and his friend to remain at the palace as his guests until the ceremony should take place, and gave them a magnificent suite of rooms.
A week later Peter and the princess were married. The poor man could hardly believe his good luck as he stood before the altar dressed in gorgeous robes. All he could do was to stare like one who is dazed, and Reynard had to nudge him from behind to get him to make the responses.
After the wedding a splendid feast was held. Jaco Peter was made a nobleman of the country after marrying the princess. All the greatest and wealthiest lords in the kingdom were invited, and then the king's carriages arrived to take the happy pair to Lord Peter's castle.
Now what was to be done? Lord Peter's castle was a broken-down hovel at the edge of the forest. He shivered with fear when he thought of what the princess would say when she saw it, with its mud floor, and its furniture consisting of one chair with no back, one battered table, and a heap of brushwood covered with a ragged pallet which served as a bed. Could Reynard overcome this difficulty too?
Reynard could, and he did! The coaches, with Reynard sitting proudly on the box of the foremost, drove on, past the hovel and soon the whole cortege halted before the gates of an enchanted castle that Reynard had borrowed from the fairies of the forest. There Lord Jaco Peter and his bride lived for many happy years. They had six children, three boys and three girls, and Reynard was the friend of them all.

Jan and Jannette were brother and sister. They lived near a big wood, and every day they used to go to play there, fishing for sticklebacks in the streams and making necklaces of red berries.
One day they wandered farther from their home than usual, and all of a sudden they came to a brook crossed by a pretty red bridge. On the other side of the bridge, half hidden among the trees, they espied the roofs of a little pink cottage, which, when they came closer, they found to be built entirely of sugar-candy! Here was a delightful find for a little boy and girl who loved sweet-stuff! They lost no time in breaking off pieces of the roof and popping them into their mouths.
Now in that house there lived an old wolf whose name was Garon. He was paralysed in one leg, and could not run very fast, but in all other respects he was as fierce and strong as he had been in his youth. When he heard Jan and Jannette breaking off bits of his roof he growled out, "Who is touching my Sugar-Candy House?"
Then he came limping out to see who it was, but by that time the children were safely hidden in the woods.
"Who dares to touch my Sugar-Candy House?" roared the wolf again.
Jan replied:
"It could be the wind so mild, the wind so mild!"
This satisfied the old wolf, and back he went to his house, grumbling.
The next day Jan and Jannette once again crossed over the little red bridge, and broke some more candy from the wolf's house. Out came Garon again, bristling all over.
"Who is touching my Sugar-Candy House?" he roared.
And Jan and Jannette replied:
"It could be the wind so mild, the wind so mild!"
"Very well," said the wolf, and went back again, but this time there was a gleam of suspicion in his eye.
The next day was stormy. Hardly had Jan and Jannette reached the Sugar-Candy House than the wolf came out and surprised them just when they were breaking a piece off his window-sill.
"Oho!" said he, and sprang at Jan and Jannette, who took to their heels and ran off as fast as their legs could carry them. Garon pursued them at a good speed in spite of his stiff paw, and although he never gained on them, yet he kept them in sight and refused to give up the chase. The children looked back once or twice, and saw that the wolf was still following them, but they were not very much afraid, because they were confident of their ability to outrun him.
All of a sudden they found their way barred by a river. There was no bridge across it, and the water was very deep. What were they to do? Nearer and nearer came the wolf!"
In the middle of the river some ducks were swimming, and Jan called out to them: "Little ducks! Little ducks! Carry us over the river on your backs, for if you don't the wolf will get us!"
The ducks came swimming up, and Jan and Jannette climbed each on to the back of one, and were carried safely over to the other bank.
Soon the wolf, in his turn, came to the river. He had seen how the children had managed to cross, and roared out at the ducks in a terrible voice, "Come and carry me, or I'll eat you all up!"
"We'll carry you a long way," answered the ducks, and came swimming to the bank. Garon balanced himself on four of them, one paw on the back of each. But they did not have in mind to carry the old wolf to the other bank, for they did not like him or his kind, and they resented the impolite way he asked them a favour. So, at a given signal from the leader, all the ducks dived in midstream and left old Garon struggling in the water. Three times he went down and three times he came up, but the fourth time he sank, he never came up again.
That was the end of old Garon. I don't know what became of his Sugar-Candy House, but if you could find the wood, and the sun had not melted the candy, or the rain washed it away, you might break a bit of it off for yourselves.

There was once on a time a queen who gave birth to little twin girls. She at once sent out invitations to twelve fairies in the neighbouring countries to come to the feast for it was a great advantage to have fairies as guests.
When the twelve fairies were all gathered in the great hall where the feast was to be held, they took their seats at the table - a very big table it was. And just then entered the wicked fairy Magotine!
The queen had not sent this fairy an invitation. But now she found a beautiful soft seat for her, and all the other fairies moved up and made room for Magotine to seat herself, saying, "Hurry up, sister, and make your wish for the little princesses, and then come and sit down."
Magotine said rudely that she might as well eat standing. "If you had wished to see me here," she retorted, "you would have sent me an invitation, as you did to my sisters here."
All her sister fairies begged her to seat herself with them, and she did so, although she growled furiously between her teeth: "Madam, I came simply to see if you had thought of me, and find that you had forgotten me altogether."
And with this she gave a tap with her wand on the table, and hissed viciously. The other fairies quitted the table. But while they were leaving the table Magotine made her way to the room where the little princesses were sound asleep. The other fairies followed her. Magotine stopped beside the cot, and, taking out her wand quickly, she touched one of the little princesses, saying at the same time, "I wish that you become the most ugly person that it would be possible to find."
Then she turned to the other little princess; but, before she could do anything further, the other fairies took a great pan full of vitriol and threw it at the wicked Magotine. But before it reached her, she disappeared.
The queen then went over to the cot and took out the little princess that Magotine had wished to be so ugly; and the child became uglier and uglier while she watched.
The good fairies discussed how they could lighten this great sorrow, so they turned to the queen and said, "Madam, it is not possible to undo the evil that Magotine has put on your child, but we will wish something that will help to balance that evil." And then they told the queen that one day her daughter would be extremely happy. With this the fairies left, carrying the beautiful presents the queen had given them.
The queen called her ugly daughter Oletlie and the charming, beautiful daughter Diana. When Oletlie was twelve years old, she went to her parents and begged them to let her to go and shut herself up in a castle far away. They still had Diana, she said.
After a long while her parents gave in, and Oletlie went away to a castle where the sea came right up to the window on one side, a forest on the other side. Her parents saw to it that she did not lack servants and supplies there.
The little princess played musical instruments and had a sweet voice. Two years went by fast, but then she began to feel homesick and wished to see her parents again; so she started on the journey home at once, and arrived just as her twin sister was going to be wed.
Now as soon as they saw Oletlie, they told her she was not to come to the marriage feast, nor to the ball afterwards. Oletlie said she had come to see her father and mother, but that she would leave again, just as they wished.
The king and queen were sorry that they had been so unkind, and asked Oletlie to remain two or three days; but Oletlie had been so offended that she refused. She turned away, took her faithful nurse with her back to the other castle, and never spoke a single word on the way.
One day, when Oletlie was walking in a very shaded valley in the forest, she saw on a tree a big green serpent who lifted his head and said to her, "Oletlie, you are not the only unhappy person. Look at my horrible form. I was born more beautiful than you."
The princess was so terrified to hear a serpent talk that she fled away and remained in her room for days. But in the end she got tired of being shut up in her room all day alone, so one evening she came down and went to the edge of the sea, wailing all the time. Then suddenly she saw coming towards her over the waves a little barque of a thousand different colours and designs on its sides.
The princess got very curious to see what was inside the barque, and made her way aboard. Then, all of a sudden, the barque turned and went out to sea. The princess ran up and caught hold of the oars, thinking to get back to her castle; but it was no use: she could do nothing at all. On and on went the barque.
"Magotine is doing me a bad turn again," she thought, "just after I was looking forward to a little pleasure in seeing my parents some days ago!"
She looked around, and there came a flashing green serpent swimming towards her in the sunlit waves. He came up to the side of the barque and said, "If you are willing to get help from a green serpent, then tell me, for I can save your life."
The princess cried, "Never show yourself to me again!"
The green serpent sighed deeply. Then he dived to the bottom of the sea.
The princess said to herself. "That he should save my life. And why should he speak like a human being?"
Suddenly a voice replied to her thoughts, and it said, "Listen, Oletlie, it is not my fault that I am a green serpent. But I am less ugly than you anyway. But I would comfort you if you would let me!"
The voice sounded sweet, although it was hissing. "I am hurt and weep over how ugly I look. I have so little to live for."
While she was complaining the little barque ran into a rock in sea. When all else had sunk, only two little pieces of wood remained. The princess caught hold of them and kept herself afloat. Then her feet touched a rock and she scrambled up on to it.
But who was coming towards her now? It was the green serpent! As if he knew that she was afraid, he moved away a little, and said, "What advantages can be had through me! But I seem only to frighten you."
And with this he threw himself back into the sea, and Oletlie remained alone on the rock. It was getting dark, she had no food to eat, and did not know where to sleep. She crept higher and higher up the rock and looked out over the sea until it was dark. After a long time she fell asleep. While she was sleeping she dreamt that she heard melodious music, and a voice singing to her. When the song was ended, she woke up and opened her eyes very carefully, for she was full of fear - and saw she was lyking on a good bed in a nice chamber. She did not know how she had got there, but got up and went out on to the wide balcony outside her chamber and saw gardens everywhere around. Outside the gardens was a green forest. Beyond the forest was a calm sea.
"Where am I?" wondered Oletlie. Then she stopped, for she heard noices from the room she had left. She went back there and found a deputy of the owner of the place. "It will be a pleasure to serve you, madam," the deputy said. "Everything you want we shall bring you, if we can, so as to make you happy."
Servants began to dance and sing and play on castanets and tambourines. When they had finished, the deputy repeated, "We are here to serve you, princess, and get you what we can."
He went on to ask her if she would now like her bath in a little grotto. The princess walked to the place he pointed to, and there she saw two bathing places. They told her that one was for her and the other for the owner of the place.
"But where is he?" asked Oletlie.
"Madam," they said, "right now he is at the war, but you shall see him when he comes back."
The princess asked if he was married, and said he was not. Oletlie then undressed and got into the bath, and when she was ready to come out of her bath, she got a dress of enjoyable colours.
The princess was astounded. As days went by, servants came to her and told her about what was happening in the world around.
One night she could not sleep, and lay awake, thinking. At last she said, "There is something missing."
"Ah, princess," said a voice, "is it not possible to stay in this palace forever, with someone you love, without ever wishing to leave it?"
"Who is speaking to me now?" she asked. "It is the owner of the palace, and he loves you, madam."
"Me?" replied the princess. "I who look so ugly?"
"Yes."
The princess did not speak again that night.
One night in winter Oletlie was asleep. On waking up, she felt that someone sat near her bed in the pitch dark. The princess put out her hand to feel, but somebody took her hand and kissed it, and in so doing let teardrops fall on it. She understood that it must be the owner of the place, although she had never seen him.
He said, "That wicked Magotine who changed you so cruelly, did the same to me. I must remain in this shape for seven years. Five have already gone by. You could lessen the sufferings of the remaining two years by marrying me."
Oletlie thought that this invisible sire was very sweet, and in the end she made up her mind to marry him without seeing how he looked like, since that was what he desired.
Then the voice said, "The consequences will be bad for us both if your curiosity should overcome you."
The princess promised to keep her word to him. But after a while she had a deep desire to see her father and mother again; also her sister and her husband. The deputyknew the road well, and led her to the castle of Oletlie's father and mother; and she felt happy.
Her mother and sister questioned Oletlie about her husband, and Oletlie remembered what her husband had told her. She told them that he did not like seeing people.
Her mother said, "Your husband is a huge monster, I suspect."
"What a terrible mistake!" screamed her sister Diana.
The princess became so confused and upset that when she was back in their own castle, she wanted to see her husband. She brought a little lamp to their bedrom, hid it and lit it when her husband slept. She saw he was the green serpent and screamed.
Now the wicked fairy Magotine appeared at once and with one wave of her wand, took away the castle, fountains and gardens. "Ah!" sighed the serpent for his wife's broken promise.
Magotine screamed furiously, "Now then, green serpent," said she, "you are to go right to my sister Proserpine, and serve her."
The green serpent went at once with great sighs, while Oletlie cried.
Magotine said to her, "I will send you to the bottom of the sea so that you won't be too happy." So saying, she took the princess to the top of the highest mountain and tied a millstone about her neck, telling her that she was to go down and bring up enough Discretion Water to fill up her great big glass, and showed the glass to the princess. The princess thought it was impossible to carry all that water.
"If you don't," said Magotine, "the green serpent will suffer more."
The threat made the ugly-looking girl walk about and look and call for Prosperine one of the good fairies, until one day the good fairy suddenly stood there by her side. She took the ugly-looking girl to the top of the mountain, gave her a little carriage drawn by two white mice and told them to go down the mountain. Then she gave the little mice a vessel to fill up with the Discretion Water for Magotine, and gave Oletlie a little pair of iron shoes to put on. She advised her not to remain on the mountain and not to stay by the fountain, but to go into a little wood and stay there for three years, for then Magotine would think that she was either toiling to get the water or that she had perished.
Oletlie thanked and kissed the good fairy for her great favours. "But, still I am grieving for not having my green serpent."
"He will come to you after you have been three years in the wood in the mountain," said the fairy, "and when you return from there you can give the water to Magotine."
Oletlie said she would not forget anything the good fairy had told her. So, when she got into her carriage, the mice took her to get the water, and afterwards they went to the wood that the fairy had told them about. It was a lovely place, and all the animals there could speak.
Three years passed, until one day Oletlie with tear-wet eyes told the animals that she was sorry to leave them. She did not forget the vessel full of Discretion Water or the little shoes of iron that the good fairy had given her. And just when Magotine thought her dead, there she was with the vessel full of water in her hand.
Magotine cried out in surprise. Where had she come from?
"Madam," said Oletlie, "I passed three years to get this water for you."
Magotine roared with laughter when she thought of the awful job this poor girl-queen must have had to get it; but then she noticed something: "What is it that I see?" she cried to Oletlie, who had changed greatly. "How did you become so nice?"
Oletlie told her that she had washed herself in the Discretion Water. That was how she had become beautiful. Magotine, on hearing this, threw the water on the ground. She snarled, "Go down to the bottomless pit and ask Proserpine to give you the Essence of Long Life for me, for I am always afraid of falling ill and of dying. When you have done this, you will be free. But don't upset anyone or drink the tiniest drop of that essence.
Oletlie began to cry, and Magotine was delighted to see it. "Go on, get away!" said she."
Oletlie walked for a long time without finding the right path, but suddenly she saw the good fairy, Prosperine, who said to her: "I know how things went and what you must do. Here is a branch of a tree: touch the earth and repeat this verse distinctly."
The queen gratefully kissed the good and generous fairy, and at the same time repeated after her:
if devoured I am to be,
He's a monster - he!"
And at once a little boy came up to them. He said, "I liked that song a lot." Then a a path opened up, the boy took Oletlie with him to somewhere deep underneath the surface of a mountain. She halfway expected to see her husband in the form of a serpent down there, but no, he had a handsome figure. The queen said:
"Even in hell I'll love him,
For a long time to come."
Her husband - for he it was - kissed her much. Then the boy took her to Proserpine. Oletlie asked her for the Essence of Long Life. The boy handed it to her, telling her not to forget what her curiosity had cost her, and to take every care this time. He led them to the fairy Magotine, and hid for a while so that Magotine should not see him.
This time the fairy Magotine at last welcomed the couple with some feeling of generosity. She gave them back the lovely palace with all the good things that they had before. So they went home, and soon found great joy in being with each other.

There was once on a time a widow who had two daughters. The eldest was so much like her in the face and humour that whoever looked on the daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them.
The youngest was like her father for courtesy and sweetness of temper, and she was beautiful too. Her mother doted on her eldest daughter, who was like her, and much disliked the youngest. She made her eat in the kitchen and work a lot. Among other things, this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and a-half off the house, and bring home a pitcher full of it.
One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink.
"Oh, yes," said this pretty little girl. At once she rinsed the pitcher, took up some water from the clearest place of the fountain, and gave it to the woman, holding up the pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier.
The good woman, having drunk, said to her, "You are so very pretty, my dear, so good and so mannerly, that I cannot help giving you a gift."
For this was a fairy, who had taken the form of a poor country woman to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go. "I will give you for a gift that there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel at every word you speak,."
When this pretty girl came home, her mother scolded her for staying so long at the fountain.
"I beg your pardon, mamma," said the poor girl, "for not making more haste." And in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses, two pearls, and two diamonds
"What is it I see there?" said the mother, quite astonished. "I think I see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth! How can this happen, child?"
This was the first time she had ever called her child.
The lovely girl told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out large numbers of diamonds while she spoke.
"I must send my child there," cried the mother, "Come here, Fanny; look what comes out of thy sister's mouth when she speaks. Wouldn't you be glad to have the same gift? You have nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly."
"It would indeed be a very fine sight," said this ill-bred minx, "to see me draw water."
"You shall go, hussy!" said the mother; "and this minute."
So away she went, but grumbling all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house.
She was no sooner at the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood a lady most gloriously dressed. The lady came up to her and asked to drink. This was, you must know, the very fairy who appeared to her sister, but now had taken the air and dress of a princess to see how far this girl's rudeness would go.
"Am I here," said the proud, saucy one, "to serve you with water? Anyway, help yourself. You may drink out of the silver tankard if you want to."
"You are not over and above mannerly," answered the fairy. "Since you are so little service-minded, I give you for a gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad."
As soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out, "Well, daughter?"
"Well, mother?" answered the pert hussy, throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads.
"Oh! mercy," cried the mother; "what is it I see? Oh! it is your wretch of a sister who has caused all this! But she shall pay for it"; and at once she ran to beat her. The poor child fled away from her and went to hide herself in the forest, not far from there.
The king's son, who was on his return from hunting, met her, and seeing her so very pretty, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried.
"Alas, sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors."
The king's son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth, wanted her to tell him how that happened. She told him the whole story. The king's son fell in love with her, and after considering that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion, he took her to the palace of the king, his father, and married her there.
As for the sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off. After wandering about for a good while she went to a corner of the wood, and there she died.

A long time ago the plain of Bessans was covered by a wide forest. A poor peasant was one day coming home through the forest. He was bringing with him two round rings of black bread, and had one slung over each arm. He was whistling merrily to himself as he was striding along, when all of a sudden a huge grey wolf stepped out on to the path before him. The wolf growled at the peasant, showing him the largest teeth that he had ever seen. The unfortunate man stopped in fear. He also knew that so large a wolf would catch him easily if he tried to run away.
There he stood, staring, while the wolf came slowly nearer. Right then the man got an idea and said with chattering teeth: "Here, wolf, you seem hungry. Try some of this good bread." He broke a piece off one of the loaves and threw it to the wolf, who ate it at once.
While the beast was eating, the peasant slipped by and hurried on his way, congratulating himself on his quick wits. But he had not gone far when he heard a sound. He looked round - it was the wolf that was loping after him.
"Heaven help me," the man thought. He broke off another piece of bread and threw it on the path behind him. "Here is more for you to eat, wolf." Then he took to his heels and ran as fast as he could. But his fastest was not fast enough, and soon, once again, he heard the wolf coming after him. He looked back over his shoulder in terror and saw how it was rapidly catching him up. He stopped and broke off another piece from the loaf and threw it on the path, then once more he ran on.
And so it went all through the forest, with the peasant running along in front and the wolf running after him and only failing to catch him because it stopped to eat the bread he threw down for it.
At last the peasant reached the edge of the forest, quite exhausted, and saw his cottage and his wife standing at the door, watching for him. He gave a great sigh of relief, for his legs were almost failing him, and besides he had no more than one piece of bread left. He stumbled up to the cottage door and leant panting against the door-post.
"Why, husband, whatever is the matter?" asked his wife. "And where is the bread you went to buy?"
He had no breath left to answer her, and only gestured towards the trees, where the wolf was appearing, bounding in the direction of the cottage with its red tongue hanging out, considerably plumper than when the peasant had first met it.
"A wolf!" she cried. "The wicked creature! Small wonder you ran like a madman. What a mercy it did not catch you."
"I gave it the bread to eat," gasped the peasant, and although he was exhausted he could not keep from grinning at how clever he had been.
"Good bread wasted on a wicked wolf!" exclaimed his wife. "I never heard such a thing in my life." Now, she was really very fond of her husband, and she was very glad to see him come safely home after his adventure, but she was also very hungry, and had been looking forward all day to a slice or two of fresh black bread to eat with her broth of carrots and cabbage.
She looked at the wolf and snapped to her husband: "You had best come indoors or that brute will finish its supper with a mouthful of you." She stamped into the cottage and the peasant went after her, but before he closed the door he looked at the piece of bread in his hands, all that was left of two large loaves. He grinned and shrugged his shoulders. "You may as well finish it, wolf," he said and threw the last of the bread to the beast and closed and bolted the door.
The wolf ate the bread and waited a while outside the cottage, and all the time the voice of the peasant's wife could be heard through the shut door. She kept railing at her husband and wishing an ill fate on the wolf as they sat down to eat their broth without any bread. When at last she ceased and all was quiet again in the cottage, the wolf returned to the forest like a grey shadow.
One morning many months later, after the peasant and his wife had worked hard and managed to save enough to buy themselves a cow, the man set off through the forest to the fair at Bourg Saint Maurice. He hoped to find an old cow going cheaply there, for he had not enough money to buy anything better. In the town he walked about looking at the cattle offered for sale, hoping to make a bargain. All of a sudden a tall, thin stranger, well dressed in grey, with a long face and a pointed chin and close-set eyes, stood before him. "You wish to buy a cow?" he asked.
"Indeed," answered the peasant. "But I have little to spend."
"In my byre I have many cows," said the stranger. "Perhaps you would like one of them."
They went together to a fine house, and in the byre behind it there were many cows, as the stranger had said. "Choose the best of them all," invited the stranger, "and I will give her to you as a gift."
The peasant was astonished, but quickly chose that cow which seemed to him to be the best. The stranger smiled, showing large white teeth. "You have chosen wisely." He tied a rope about the cow's neck and handed the rope to the peasant. "She is yours," he said, "and may she give you plentiful milk for many years." He put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a little box. "This," he said, "is a gift for your wife." The peasant, wondering, took the box, and the stranger led him to the street.
"But why," asked the bewildered peasant, "are you doing such a kindness to me?"
The stranger smiled again. "Do you remember how you once showed kindness to a wolf and fed him with two loaves? Well, I always return measure for measure. And now good-bye."
Amazed and delighted, the peasant set off through the forest for home, leading his cow and carrying the little box. Soon he began to wonder what could be in the box, and with every step he took his curiosity grew greater, until at last he stopped, turnedthe box this way and that, shaking it and sniffing at it, trying to guess what was in it. "A good wife should have no secrets from her husband, so there may be no harm in my having a peep inside first," he said to himself.
He sat down beneath a young larch-tree while the cow grazed a little way off, and carefully opened the box. Out of the box leapt a tall flame which set fire to a branch of the larch-tree. The peasant dropped the box and sprang frightened to his feet. "Had it been my wife who opened it," he thought at once, "her hair and her cap would have caught fire, our house would perhaps have burnt down and she would perhaps have been burnt to death."
The larch-tree was burning fiercely, and since the peasant had no idea how to put out a fire in a tree, he hurried off home with his cow, very thankful that he had been curoius enough to open the box before he was i,ndoors.
From the larch-tree the fire spread to the whole forest of Bessans, and the greater part of it was burnt to ashes. But the peasant and his wife lived on happily in their cottage with the cow, which was by far the best in the whole district.

There was once a man who was coming home through the woods. Walking under a pine tree, he heard someone call his name. It was a big snake. The snake had crept up the tree, from branch to branch, and now was wound around the very top. It could not get back down again.
"But snake, if I help you out of the tree, you'll bite me as soon as you're back down, won't you."
"Oh no - I promise."
Gripping with his knees and pulling with his arms, the man clambered up to the top of the tree. "Wrap yourself around my neck," he told the snake. "Don't worry, you won't fall."
The man clambered down again with his snake necktie on, and jumped to the ground.
"And now," said the snake, "I want to bite you!"
"But you promised you wouldn't bite me!"
"Have you heard a snake is upright?"
"No, no, I won't take that! We must get a judgment!"
Just then a fox popped out from among the rocks and junipers of the ravine.
"Tell us, fox. Is it right to harm someone who has helped you?" said the man.
"Well," replied the fox, "that depends on one thing and another. Let's see. Tell me what happened."
They told him. He thought it all over and flicked his ears.
"Listen," he said, "this is rather a special case. If I'm to judge it properly, I'll have to have you two go back to where you were when you first met."
The snake went to the pine tree and slithered up to the top.
"Is that how you were a while ago, all the way up there?"
"Yes, fox."
"All right, snake, then stay there!"
The man thanked the fox. "That was a spot of trouble you got me out of!" he said. "I won't forget what you've done for me. I'll run home and bring you something!"
The fox waited among the junipers, licking his chops. But when the fox saw the man returning with a gun, he said to himself, "I won't wait. After all, a judge shouldn't take gifts."
He stole off that minute and disappeared. "Do a good turn to someone who is not upright and decent, and watch out for what may be your lot in return.

A little chicken one day got a beating by his parents and ran away from the hen house with his two brothers. All day long they looked for a place to stay, but found neither a cave or an abandoned house. So they went into the wood, chose a small clearing and began to build a hut.
After eight days they had finished their hut and placed a bouquet on the roof to celebrate their new home. Unfortunately the elder brother among them danced and wiggled so long that in the end he broke wind. It came so fast and strongly that it knocked down the hut.
The noise was so loud that their parents heard it and said to themselves: "It can only be our chickens!" At that they hurried into the wood, and there they found their chickens. Quite ashamed they took them home to the farm again.

Quackling was very little, that is why he was called Quackling. However, tiny as he was he had brains, and he knew what he was about, for having begun with nothing he ended by amassing a hundred crowns.
Now the king of the country was a spendthrift who never kept any money. When he heard that Quackling had some, he went one day to him himself and borrowed his hoard.
For quite some time afterwards, Quackling was proud of having lent money to the king. But after the first and second year, seeing that they king never even dreamed of paying the interest, Quackling became uneasy, so much so that at last he resolved to go to the king to get repaid. So one fine morning Quackling, very trim and fresh, took to the road, singing,
Quack, quack, quack,
when shall I get my money back?
He had not gone far when he met his friend, the fox, who was on his rounds that way.
"Good-morning, neighbour," said the fox, "where are you off to so early?"
"I am going to the king for what he owes me."
"Oh! take me with you!"
Quackling said to himself: "One cannot have too many friends." . . . "I will," said he, "but going on all-fours you will soon be tired. Make yourself quite small, get into my throat - go into my gizzard and I will carry you."
"Happy thought!" said the fox.
He took bag and baggage, and, entered the little duck.
Quackling walked further, all trim and fresh, still singing,
Quack, quack, quack,
when shall I get my money back?
He had not gone far when he met his lady-friend Ladder, leaning on her wall.
"Good morning, my duckling," said the lady friend, "where are you off so bold?"
"I am going to the king for what he owes me."
"Oh! take me with you!"
Quackling said to himself: "One can't have too many friends." . . . "I will," said he, "but with your wooden legs you will soon be tired. Make yourself quite small, get into my throat - go into my gizzard and I will carry you."
"Happy thought!" said Ladder, and entered the little duck to keep company with their friend, the fox.
And "Quack, quack, quack," Quackling was off again, singing and trim as before. A little farther he meets his friend River, who was wandering quietly in the sunshine.
"Where are you going on this muddy road?" asked River.
"I am going to the king for what he owes me."
"Oh! take me with you!"
Quackling said to himself: "We can't be too many friends." . . . "I will," said he, "but to spare you of the road, make yourself quite small, get into my throat - go into my gizzard and I will carry you."
"Ah! happy thought!" said the friendly River.
She took bag and baggage, and glou, glou, glou, found a place between the fox and the ladder in the little duck.
And "Quack, quack, quack." Quackling was off again singing.
A little farther on he met his comrade, Wasp's-nest. He was manoeuvring its wasps.
"Well, good-morning, Quackling," said Wasp's-nest, "where are you bound for so trim and fresh?"
"I am going to the king for what he owes me."
"Oh! take me with you!"
Quackling said to himself, "One can't have too many friends." . . . "I will," said he, "but with your many wasps to drag along, you may soon be tired. Make yourself quite small, go into my throat - get into my gizzard and I will carry you."
"That's a good idea!" said Wasp's-nest and very soon joined the others with all his party. There was not much more room, but by closing up a bit they managed. Very soon Quackling was off again singing.
He arrived at the capital, and threaded his way straight up the High Street, still running and singing,
Quack, quack, quack,
when shall I get my money back?
The good folks who heard it, were greatly astonished. Soon enough Quackling came to the king's castle.
He struck with the knocker: "Toc! toc!"
"Who is there?" asks the porter, putting his head out of the an opening beside the door.
"It is I, Quackling. I wish to speak to the king."
"Speak to the king! . . . That's easily said. The king is dining, and will not be disturbed."
"Tell him that it is I, and he knows very well why I have come."
The porter shut his opening and went up to say it to the king, who was just sitting down to dinner with a napkin round his neck, with all his ministers.
"Good, good!" said the king laughing. "I know what it is about! Make him come in, and put him with the turkeys and chickens."
The porter descended.
"Have the goodness to enter."
"Good!" said Quackling to himself, "I shall now see how they eat at court."
"This way, this way," said the porter. "One step further. . . . There, there you are."
"How? What? in the poultry yard?"
How vexed Quackling was!
"Ah! so that's it," said he. "Wait! I will compel you to receive me. Quack, quack, quack, when shall I get my money back?"
But turkeys and chickens don't like those who re not as themselves. When they saw the newcomer and how he was made, and when they heard him crying too, they began to look black at him.
"What is it? What does he want?"
Finally they rushed at him all together, to overwhelm him with pecks.
"I am lost!" said Quackling to himself, when by good luck he remembered the fox in his gullet and cried to him:
"Reynard, Reynard, come out fast,
Or my life may justy not last."
The fox was only waiting for these words. He hastened out, threw himself on the wicked fowls, and quick! quack! he tore them to pieces; so much so that after five minutes there was not one left alive. Quackling, quite content, began to sing again,
Quack, quack, quack,
when shall I get my money back?
When the king who was still at table heard this refrain, and the poultry woman came to tell him what had been going on in the yard, he was terribly annoyed, and ordered them to throw Quackling into the well to make an end of him.
It was done as the king commanded. Quackling was at first in despair of getting himself out of such a deep hole, but then he remembered his lady friend, the Ladder.<
"Ladder, Ladder, come out fast,
Or it over for me at last."
The friendly ladder was only waiting for these words. She hastened out, leant her two arms on the edge of the well, and then Quackling climbed nimbly up and hop! he was in the yard, and began to sing louder than ever.
When the king, who was still at table and laughing at the good trick he had played someone he owed money, heard him reclaiming his money again, he became outraged with rage.
He commanded that the furnace should be heated, and the little duck thrown into it as a sorcerer.
The furnace was soon hot, but this time Quackling was not so afraid; he counted on his sweet friend River.
"River, River, flow out fast,
Or I doubt that I can last."
The river hastened out, and errouf! threw herself into the furnace and flooed it and all the people who had lighted it. Afterwards she flowed growlingly into the hall of the palace to the height of more than four feet.
And Quackling, quite content, began to swim, singing deafeningly,
Quack, quack, quack,
when shall I get my money back?
The king was still at table and thought himself quite sure of his game, but when he heard Quackling singing again and when others told him all that had passed, he became furious and got up from table, waving his fists.
"Bring him here, and I'll cut his throat! bring him here quick!" he cried.
Quickly two footmen ran to fetch Quackling.
"At last they have decided to receive me," said Quackling, going up the great stairs.
Imagine his terror when on entering he sees the king as red as a turkey cock, and all the ministers attending the king standing sword in hand. Quackling thought this time it was all up with him, but luckily he remembered that there was still one friend left in him, and he cried with dying accents:
"Wasp's-nest, Wasp's-nest, make a sally,
Or Quackling nevermore may rally."
The wasps flew out and the scene changed. "Bs, bs, bayonet them!" The wasps threw themselves on the infuriated king and his ministers and stung them so fiercely in the face that they lost control, and not knowing where to hide themselves they all jumped pell-mell from the window and broke their necks on the pavement.
Quackling was much astonished to find himself all alone in the big hall. Nevertheless, he remembered what he had come for to the palace, and set to work to hunt for his dear money. But he rummaged in all the drawers in vain; he found nothing; all had been spent.
Ferreting in this way from room to room he came at last to the one with the throne in it. He felt fatigued and sat down on it to think over his adventure. In the meantime the people had found their king and his ministers with their feet in the air on the pavement, and they had gone into the palace to know how it had happened. On entering the throne-room, the crowd saw that there was already someone on the royal seat, and broke out in cries of surprise and joy:
"The king is dead, long live the king! Heaven has sent us down this thing."
Quackling, who was no longer much surprised at anything, received the applause of the people as if he had never done anything else all his life.
A few of them murmured that a duck might not be a fine king, but those who knew him replied that a wise Quackling was a much worthier king than a spendthrift like the one who was lying on the pavement. In short, they ran and took the crown off the head of the deceased king, and placed it on the head of Quackling. It fitted.
Thus he became king.
"And now," he said after the ceremony, "ladies and gentlemen, let's go to supper. I'm so hungry!"

Once there was a cock that was so old that the farmer decided to slaughter him. But the cock overheard what the farmer was about to do to him, and headed for the woods. On the way he met a sheep.
"Hello, rooster!"
"Hello, sheep! What are you doing?" said the rooster.
"Nothing much."
"Do you want to come with me?"
"Yes."
On the way they met a cat.
"Hello, rooster and sheep!" said the cat.
"Hello, cat, what are you doing?"
"Nothing much."
"Do you want to come with us?" said the rooster and the sheep.
"Yes."
In the night they saw a house with no lights coming out from the windows. The three companions went closer and found that three wolves lived there, and then they went up on the roof. A wild boar's skin was attached to the top of the chimney there to keep rain out.
The sheep sent the skin to the bottom of the chimney. When the sooted, heavy skin came banging down, the wolves were scared and fled at full speed. The three companions went into the house. The cock settled on a shelf, the sheep found a place next to the door, while the cat jumped into a corner by the fireplace.
But one of the wolves had forgotten his knife, and came back to look for it.
From his shelf the rooster said, "If I make use of my two sickles, I will cut off your head."
The cat said to him from his fireplace corner: "If I go with my awl, I'll tear out his eyes."
Terrified, the wolf started off at full speed for the door. Then the sheep, who stood next to it, butted him in the flanks.
When the wolf found his comrades, he said to them: "There was a reaper who wanted to cut my neck, a shoemaker who wanted to tear out my eyes, and a barrel-maker who rammed me in the back!"

There once were three little pigs. All summer long they roamed through the woods and over the plains, playing games and having fun. They were happy, easily made friends, and were always given a hearty welcome. But as summer drew to a close, they saw all others were drifting back to their usual jobs, preparing for winter.
Autumn came and it began to rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Much of the fun was over now, and they must set to work, they too, and get a roof over their heads. They talked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig said he'd build a straw hut.
"It will only take a day," he said.
The others disagreed. "It's too fragile," they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen.
Not quite so careless, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned wood. "Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!" It took him two days to nail them together.
But the third little pig did not like the wooden house. "That's not the way to build a house!" he said. "It takes time, patience and hard work to build a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind, rain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf roaming in the forest out there, ready to transgress against our welfare."
The days went by, and the wisest little pig's house took shape, brick by brick. From time to time his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle:
"Why are you working so hard on yourself? Won't you come and play?"
But the bricklaying pig just said, "No, I shall finish my house first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I'll come and play!" he said.
It was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the neighbourhood. The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling fiercely at the laziest pig's straw hut.
"Come out and do as I say!" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you all!"
"I'd rather stay where I am!" replied the little pig in a tiny voice.
"Then I'll make you come out!" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his chest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew with all his might, right onto the house. All the straw the little pig had heaped against some thin poles, fell down in the great blast.
Excited by his own success, the wolf did not notice that the little pig had slithered out from underneath the heap of straw, and was dashing towards his brother's wooden house. When he realised that the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.
"Come back!" he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden house.
The other little pig greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf.
"I hope this house won't fall down! Let's lean against the door so he cannot break in!"
Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs' words. Starving as he was, at the idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door.
"Open up! Open up! I want to speak to you!"
Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door fast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself to a new effort: he drew in a really giant breath, and went . . . WHOOOOO!
The wooden house collapsed like a pack of cards. Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window of his own brick house, and he quickly opened the door to his fleeing brothers and closed it firmly behind them. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering furiously on the door.
This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house looked much more solid than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for a third time. But all was in vain. For the house did not budge an inch. The three little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade.
Quite exhausted by his efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a nearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the wisest little pig had seen what happened, and he quickly said:
"Quick now! Light the fire!"
With his legs thrust down the chimney, the wolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn't be easy to get in, but the sound of the little pigs' voices below only made him feel hungrier.
"I am dying of hunger! I am going to try and get down."
And so he let himself drop. But landing was too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned by his fall. The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.
"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimney!" he squealed, as he tried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could. The three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to sing:
"Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked wolf will never come back!"
From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig's brothers set to work with a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf did return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of three chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of his burnt tail, and left for good.
Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers:
"No more work! Come on, let's go and play!"

Once there was a king's son, who carried on the government after his father had died. But by marrying he incurred the hatred of his mother, because he had not selected a bride who pleased her.
Not long after the wedding the king had to go to a war that lasted three years. His queen had meanwhile given birth to two fine boys. The mother of the king now sought to take her revenge, and wrote to the king that someone had given birth to a misshaped creature.
The king wrote back that such a woman was to be shut up in the hunger-tower, and the misbirth was to be cast into the water, all according to the customs then. This was done: The two boys were placed in a box that was then thrown into the water. The queen in the tower did not starve to death there though; she found food near the door to her room every morning.
Near the castle was the pleasure-garden, and the gardener found the box when he was fetching water. He opened it and found the boys inside. Full of joy he ran to his wife, and said, "Here is a couple of boys that we may adopt for our own!"
The boys grew up and learnt gardening.
Meanwhile the king had come home again, and the first thing he did was to ask for his queen. His mother reminded him that he himself had ordered the queen to be shut up in the hunger-tower for giving birth to a misshapen child. The king suddenly remembered, and also thought his mother told the truth about his offspring when she told him that one boy had had an ox's head and the other a horse's head.
But from that time the king had no more rest. One evening as he passed by the hunger-tower he saw a light in its upper part. He went to the keeper and had the key given to him. When he came to the door of the prison where he saw the light, he peeped through the keyhole, and saw his wife. He opened the door and fell on the queen's neck and begged her pardon. He asked her if she had had a misbirth. "No," she said as he brought her back to the castle. Soon the wicked mother was torn asunder by four horses.
Search was made for the two boys, but in vain. The gardener was dead recently, but the two sons kept the garden in so good order that the king appointed them gardeners.
In return for this the two brothers desired to give king enjoyment by bringing the sounding tree, the speaking bird, and the golden water into his garden. Many had sought for these three things, but none had succeeded.
The eldest brother set out and came to a hermit. He asked the hermit whether he knew anything of the three objects, and how he could come by them.
The hermit said, "My dear child, many hundreds have come to me and have asked the same question, but not one has returned, because not one did just what the bird told."
The gardener begged the hermit only to show him the way, and promised that he would do as the bird told.
"Take this road," said the hermit, "and you will hear the sounding tree."
And, in fact, after three days' travel, the gardener heard the sounding of the tree. Before he came up to it he had to pass through a great heap of stones that had the form of human beings.
Then he heard a voice call, "Good morning, young man, what do you want here?"
He looked round, and saw the speaking bird on the sounding tree. "It is you I want," said the gardener, "and the sounding tree and the golden water."
The bird said, "Break off a bough and take me with the basket down from the tree. Then go to the rock over there, there lies a key. Take the key and open the door in the rock. With the vessel that you will find in the rock, take of the golden water, and when you come out of the rock, do not look behind you, but go straight on."
The gardener went, but as he came out of the rock, the men-like stones came after him, and cried, "Brother, take me with you." Hearing the noise, he looked round, and was changed on the spot into a stone.
The second brother meantime waited for him, and as he did not come, he too set out on the road and came to the hermit, and asked him the way to the sounding tree, and whether his brother had not passed by that way.
"Yes," said the hermit, "but he cannot have done exactly as the bird instructed him to do, and so he has not come back."
"What road will I have to take to come to the sounding tree?"
The hermit showed him the way, and gave him the same directions as his brother had got.
After three days he heard the tree sound, and came to the stones. Seeing the stones, he thought they were men, and touched them, but they were only stones. The bird wished him good morning, and asked him what he wanted.
"You," he answered, "and the sounding tree, and the golden water." Now he had to do the same things as his brother had done.
When he stepped out of the rock, the stones followed and made a fearful noise, and cried, "Brother, take me with you."
But he went on, taking no heed of the noise, though it grew louder and louder. However, he was so frightened that he fell to the ground. When he recovered and rose, he saw that many hundreds, released by him, stood around him. His brother and he now went with the bough, the bird, and the golden water to their home. Then the bird said,
"Place now the bough in the earth, dig a pit by the side of it, and place the vessel in it with the water. Then hang me with the basket on the bough and go to rest. Until early morning all will be wonders."
When the brothers awoke early next morning they heard the tree sounding, and the golden water was flowing down a high rock. The king heard the sound and asked what it was, but none could say. At last he went down into the garden, and was not little astonished to see the tree, the water, and the bird. Many kings came and wondered at the beautiful sight. As they loudly exclaimed, "How beautiful!" the bird said, "But one thing is not beautiful."
"And what is that?" asked they. The bird answered, "That the king suffers his sons to be gardeners."
"What does this mean?" said the king. The bird, who knew much of what passed in the world, now told him what had happened. And the king, the queen, and all present, greatly rejoiced that the two lost sons had been found.

Once there lived in a great city a mighty king. He had an only daughter. When she had reached her eighteenth year, and no bridegroom had offered himself, the king thought it would be best to give his daughter to any man who would perform the tasks assigned to him by the king. To this end the king caused the tower which stood in his city, and was famed for its immense size and height, to be decked with banners. It was so high that all his subjects could see it.
At first people did not know what the banners on the old tower meant, but when they asked about it, they were told so. Then the three sons of a peasant, Mathias, Jacob, and Hans, decided to try their luck. They set out, and in passing through their father's garden, the eldest said to the youngest, "Shut the garden door."
Hans thought he said, "Take the door." So Hans took the door off its hinges, and carried it on his back.
The two others went in front and did not trouble themselves much about Hans, and did not once notice that he was carrying the door on his back. When the night came on, they had to look out for a place to sleep in, and decided after some discussion to climb a tree, so that they might be safe from the wild beasts. Now the brothers noticed for the first time that Hans had brought the garden door along with him. They scolded him for this, and told him he must carry the door up the tree, so that no trace of a human presence was to be seen on the ground. And they pushed, and pushed till they had got the door up.
The brothers now stretched themselves out, and soon fell asleep. But they were awakened by some shots, and to their great horror they saw some robbers approaching the tree, and went on to camp underneath it. Although the brothers kept quite quiet, the robbers soon observed that someone was above, and loaded their guns to fire at the strangers. Hans, seeing these preparations, was so terrified that he let the door fall, and by its fall it killed the robbers.
The two elder brothers now perceived that they were saved by Hans, and behaved more kindly to him. The three wanderers remained sitting on the tree all night, and waited the break of day to continue on their way.
As soon as the first streak of dawn appeared, the three brothers came down and went on their way singing. After some hours they had reached the royal court, asked for entrance, and told why they had come.
Then the king said, "Two of you may go, for I have only one daughter, and she only needs one groom."
None of the brothers wanted to give way, and it even came to a quarrel, till at last the king commanded the eldest of the brothers, Mathias, to stay. The king then asked him about his situation and gave him the following task:
"You are to come sailing to me on a golden ship, but not on the water. The ship must not have wheels, but must sail through the air."
When Matthias had heard this, he went sadly home, and quite alone, for the other brothers had already gone before.
Next day Matthias went into the forest, and in the hope that the king would consider the task done if the ship was made of wood, he hit a fine tree and worked day and night on the ship. On the third day he felt very tired and could not help falling asleep. When he woke up, an old man came to him and asked for a piece of bread.
Matthias drove him off roughly. The man walked away and said: "Matthew, Matthew, you'll regret it."
Hardly had he uttered these words, he was gone and the tree that had almost assumed the form of a ship was in its former glory again before the astonished Matthias.
Gradually his surprise gave way to anger because his three day's work was for nothing. He went home and told his misfortune to his parents, but they could give him no explanation of it.
The deadline had passed, and Matthias was still at home. Two days after the expiry of the time there came messengers, and sadly Mathias went to the royal castle. He could not excuse himself, and so was condemned to death.
When his parents heard of this they were greatly troubled, and forbade the two younger brothers to woo the king's daughter. But the brothers had not in mind to obey, and the second went into a dense forest and selected a fine tree. He then began, like his brother, to hew the trunk into a ship. When in his weariness he fell asleep, there came a woman, woke up the sleeper, and begged for money. Jacob treated her harshly, and she went away, saying, "Tree, stand up!" and at once the tree stood up again in its full glory.
So Jacob fared no better than his brother, for he had not accomplished the task.
And now came the turn of the youngest brother. Hans went into the forest, hewed down a fine tree, and built out of it a ship. He finished his task singing; and when it was done there came to him a hideous old woman and demanded a kiss. Hans did not hesitate, but hugged and kissed the old woman, not once, but several times.
Then she said to him, "The victory is yours!" She then repeated something over the ship, and suddenly the ship was changed into pure gold, and began to move. It carried Hans to a great mountain, and here it rested. Hans waited till the ship should again begin to move. But this lasted too long, for he had already eaten the bread that his mother had given him.
When the third day had passed and the ship was still at rest, he cried in despair, "Woman, come to me!" All at once he then heard a rustling well. He went up to it and said, "Dear fountain, help me!" And suddenly Hans read these words on the surface of the brook: "Not far from me lies a pipe. Take it on your ship."
He sought the pipe and found it too. Then he went into his boat and began to whistle. A man appeared and asked: "What do you want?"
Hans told him his trouble, and the man told him than when Hans urgently needed water, he should just whistle and he himself would come and get him some.
Soon after the ship began to move and carried him to a field. Here, it stopped. A hunter came and gave Hans a trumpet with the remark, "Only blow if you need anything, and you will see what an expert hunter can do for you."
Then the ship began moving again and carried him to the castle of the king.
The king looked with astonishment on the man and the ship that could fly so cleverly and admirably through the air. Hans stepped out of the ship, and the king invited him to a merry feast. Then Hans asked the king for the second task, and the king answered, "Get me just a jug of water the moment you stand up from your chair by this table."
Hans remembered his pipe and whistled at once, and the pitcher was on the table when he stood up.
The third task was to call together all the sheep in the world, and let the king see them. Hans blew on his trumpet, and suddenly there was a multitude of sheep, including all those that kings owned in other countries.
The next day the betrothal ceremony was to take place. But the princess would not recognise Hans as her husband, and begged the king to set him some further tasks.
The king refused, saying, "Hans has performed his three tasks." So nothing helped against it; the princess had to become his wife, and as luck would have it, lived long and happily with him.

The beautiful castle of Stolzenfels, which is now entirely restored, was founded in the middle of the 1200s by Arnold von Isenbourg, the archbishop of Cleves. It was once inhabited by Othmar and Willeswind, a brother and sister. Having lost their parents, the two were devoted to each other and to the care of their numerous retainers, who idolised them both.
The brother and sister were always together, so Willeswind grieved sorely when her brother had to go off to war. He took all the able-bodied men with him, and left none but the old men, women, and children at home. As there were many lawless robber-knights along the Rhine in those days, Willeswind prudently ordered that the castle gates should remain constantly closed, and only sallied forth at midday, to visit a few of her pensioners in the village and carry them the alms she was wont to bestow.
One evening while she was sitting in the hall with all her household servants, keeping the women busily at work spinning and watching the men as they burnished their arms, the warder suddenly came to announce a pilgrim who was begging for shelter. Willeswind at once gave admitted him into the castle. But in spite of his worn garments he inspired her with a vague feeling of fear, for his face was cunning and cruel, and his roving glances seemed to take note of the castle defenses and of the small number of her aged employees.
Her suspicions were shared by the warder, and were only too soon justified. For although the pilgrim left peaceably next morning, he came back three days later in full armour and coolly demanded her hand in marriage, and threatening to take her by force if she did not say yes to his proposal within three days.
Willeswind knew it would be impossible for her aged household employees to hold out against the robber knight's forces till her brother could come to her rescue. Yet she dispatched a message to her brother, before finally deciding to take the warder's advice and withdraw into a neighbouring convent.
On her way there she fell into an ambush laid by the treacherous knight. He soon overcame the brave but feeble resistance of her small escort of servants, took her captive and carried her off with her maid to a lonely tower in the woods. There he locked them both in, declaring he would come in three days' time to get her yes.
As soon as he had departed, Willeswind and her maid began to inspect the premises, but could devise no means to escape: The walls were thick, doors and windows heavily barred, andthey could find neither water nor food. While the captives were peering anxiously through the barred windows, and realised that the tower lay in the wilderness where no passer-by were likely to come to their aid, Willeswind suddenly saw her pet raven, and whistled it to her side.
She and Othmar had trained this bird to bring them berries at a sign, and she now resolved to make good use of the faithful raven. It journeyed busily to and fro, bringing so many luscious berries that Willeswind and her maid did not suffer acutely from either hunger or thirst. Three days later the robber knight appeared. He was much surprised when Willeswind rejected him again, and left, saying he would return in three days. Then she would probably be more willing, he thought.
Time passed very slowly in the gloomy prison. In spite of the faithful raven's incessant visits, the girls were faint and weak. However, on the sixth day, while watching for the bird to return, Willeswind suddenly saw a knight come out from the thicket and ride by. She judged by his horse and armour that it could not be her fiend and called aloud for aid, and wildly waved her handkerchief through the bars.
A moment later the knight had turned, and with a cry of rapture Willeswind recognized Othmar. He was riding through the forest to reach home sooner. Before he could take any measures to deliver her, however, the robber knight came riding up the overgrown path, and seeing him, challenged him to fight. Othmar, furious at the man's insolent behavior, and at the treatment he had made poor Willeswind endure, fought so bravely that he soon stretched his antagonist lifeless on the ground. Then he seized the keys at his belt, and freed the captives who had languished in the tower for six long days.
As he and Willeswind slowly rode away, the raven, returning with a host of its companions, swooped down on the robber knight's corpse and pecked out its eyes. Willeswind, safe home once more in her beloved Stolzenfels, now recounted all her adventures to her brother, who ordered an image of the raven to be placed above the gateway, to commemorate the fidelity of the pet bird that had helped two humans survive by his efforts.

In the old times, when there still was a castle up there on the hill, a count and his wife lived there. They had goods in abundance and could have been the happiest couple if they have not been wanting a child and domestic peace. From early morning till late at night the count and countess were squabbling and wrangling, and he never spoke of his wife other than by "the snake".
It went on like that for many long years, and the count became even worse, till his wife finally became pregnant. Then the cruel count turned friendly and happy at the thought of a future heir. This went on for many weeks, but when his wife finally gave birth, it was to a slippery snake.
The hopes of the count were crushed. He raged like a wild beast and scolded vehemently and much. His wife was a wicked witch, he growled; he called here a beast who was allied with the devil. He also wanted to kill the snake at once, but the countess begged so long and fervently that he let the baby live. But he was cruel and gruff ever since, and did not care for his wife or child, and went his way.
The countess, however, loved the snake as if it were the most beautiful boy, and was day and night by the cradle. The snake grew and grew, and the countess still held him dear and nursed him. This went on for twenty years, and the snake never came out of her chamber.
When he was twenty years old and the countess was sitting in the chamber with him one evening, he suddenly opened its mouth and began to speak.
"Dear mother," he said, "I am now twenty years old and want to get married, so I ask you to get me a bride."
The countess was surprised when she heard her child speak, and even more surprised about what he said. She promised to fulfill his wish, and searched for a bride for her snake. But to find a willing one was not easily done. The snake kept asking for his bride each day, and the countess looked more and more anxiously for a bride for her child, but could not find any.
Then she came to think of the girl who herded their hens. It was a very sweet, obedient child. The countess thought the girl would agree to become a countess, but the hen girl said she would rather remain a poor hen girl and eat dark bread than to live in wealth with a snake for her husband. She did not like the idea of that.
When the countess heard this, she was angry with the girl and said: "If you don't want to be a success, I'll find another."
But every time the countess sought a bride for her snake son, she was disappointed. Then she turned again to the dear, pious hen maid with beautiful, sweet words. "Do not be so stupid that you stand in the way of your happiness," she said to her. "If you marry my child, you will be a countess and wil be provided for all your life. But what do you have to look forward to if you remain a hen shepherd? Then you will have to feed the hens and will always be the lowest servant. But if you take my advice, honour and riches will play laughingly with you."
Thus the countess talked and urged till the poor child did not know what to do. And when the countess saw that the girl was swayed in her helplessness, she pressed on, till the child asked for three days to think things over. The countess was pleased and left the child that day.
Next day she came back, however, and asked what the girl had decided. The second day she did the same thing. Then the child did not know what to do, and thought, "If heaven is not giving me good advice, I do not know what to do. If I do not marry the snake, then I will get no peace because the countess is so pushy, and I have no wish to marry the snake."
With these doubts in her mind she went up to the castle and into the hall. In one corner there was a pretty image of the Madonna. The pious girl said her Hail Mary in front of it, and prayed for advice on what to do in this case.
After some time the painting spoke up: "Marry the child of the countess, for you may redeem it. The sinful life of his parents made their child be born a snake, but you can help it to become a human. Listen, then. On the wedding night when you are alone with the snake in the bridal chamber, he will say: 'Take off your clothes!" Then you must say: 'You undress first!" The snake will then shed his skin. Then he will say again: "Take off your clothes!" And then you have to reply again: 'You undress first!" Then the snake will shed his skin again. This should be done seven times, and when you have said for the seventh time: 'You undress first!" the snake will shed his seventh skin, and will stand before you as a beautiful young man."
When all this had been said, the madonna was silent again. A stone was lifted from the heart of the girl, and she felt light and calm. She thanked heaven for the help and then went to the countess and told her that she wanted to marry the snake.
The countess was delighted and called the hen girl her dear daughter, and then she went with her to her child and presented her as his bride. And because the countess was afraid the girl might change her mind, she would have the couple married the same day. She gave the hen girl jewelry and clothes, and when the girl had washed, clothed and decorated herself, the countess fetched the priest, who wed the couple.
The countess was happy with the outcome and wished the couple good luck. The snake was also merry, and fondled his bride a lot. Evening came, and with it, the stars in the sky. The countess said goodbye to the couple, and left them alone.
When the serpent and his bride were alone in the room, he said, "Take off your clothes!" And the bride answered: "You get undressed first out!"
The snake seemed to be happy about this response, and straightway peeled off his skin. Then she spoke again: "Take off your clothes!" The bride answered: "You get undressed first out," and the snake removed another skin. Then he spoke again: "Take off your clothes", and the bride answered as she had done the first two times. This went on seven times. Then, as the snake took off his seventh and final skin, a wonderful young man was in front of her instead of the snake. She had never seen a more beautiful knight. He hurried to her, hugged her and hugged her and called her his dear, dear bride and redeemer. Then they went to bed together and slept blissfully till morning dawned and the courtyard resounded with many sounds.
When day had broken and the happy couple came out of the chamber, the countess was standing at the door, for she was very curious about what had passed on the wedding night. When she saw a beautiful man instead of the ugly serpent she was astonished and could not believe their eyes. But when the handsome knight called her mother and kissed her hand, she understood it was her son, and so her joy knew no bounds.
Now the time had come to celebrate the wedding, but the happiness did not last long. For when the old countess looked at her son and saw how beautiful he was, it occurred to her that he was too good for the hen girl, and she envied her such a fine husband too. In a short time she tried to persuade her son to leave his wife. The young count, however, loved his wife dearly and had no ears for the advice of his mother, and his wife remained loyal. As the old countess pressed him again and was determined to get rid of his wife, he said: "I owe my wife my salvation, and therefore I will remain grateful and loyal to her for ever."
After that speech, the countess did not try to separate them any more and was quite satisfied. The young couple lived a long, long time quite happily.

A broom-maker with an only daughter once went into the forest to fetch twigs to make more brooms of, saying to himself as he walked along, "A bundle of twigs tied to a handle - a broom. Another bundle of twigs tied to another handle - another broom". As he walked along, a little bird kept running to and fro in front of him. He caught the bird, took it home and put it in a cage. There it began so beautifully that they had never heard the like of it.
One morning when the broom-maker fed the bird, there was an egg in the cage, and the egg looked like gold. The daughter was sent to market to sell it. As she sat there, a great man came, saw the egg and asked what it cost. The girl said she thought he himself knew how much it was worth, and then the great man gave her a bag of gold for it. She took the gold and went home, full of joy.
The next day the little bird again laid an egg. The girl carried it to market, and the gentleman again came. This time he gave her two bags of gold for the egg. At the same time he asked if the bird was for sale.
"Oh yes," she answered, "at the right price."
The gentleman soon paid a lot of gold for the bird, so much that the broom-maker gave up his business and lived happily with his daughter.
However, in the home of the gentleman the caged bird did not sing any longer, but looked very sad, ate nothing, and died. The gentleman was sorry for it all. Then, when he took the bird out of the cage to try to see what it had died of, he noticed a note in the beak of the bird. On the note was written,
Whoever eats my head, will find a bag of gold under his head every morning when waking up, and whoever eats my heart will come to rule the country.
"Not bad at all," thought the gentleman, "but who could have put the note there?" He puzzled over it a little, but could not find out of it. Instead he wanted to see if the message was right, and had the bird cooked at once. While his cook was roasting the bird on a spit, two hungry boys came in and begged for food. The cook said they had to wait till she had roasted the bird.
As the boys stood beside her and watched, a little piece of food fell down from the spit. The oldest boy bent down, took it up from the ashes and ate it. After some time another piece fell down. The cook did not mind, for the pieces were tiny, and she had not been instructed to keep what might fall down from the spit. This time the youngest boy bent down and ate the little piece. But the two pieces that had fallen from the bird on the spit, were the head and the heart of the bird.
When the bird was roasted, the cook put it on the table, and the gentleman ate it in a good mood, halfway hoping for a miracle. But as he got up the next day and hoped to find a bag gold under his pillow, he was disappointed. There was no such bag to be found.
The two boys walked on until night fell on, and asked a farmer for shelter overnight. They got it. In return they were to spread straw on the stable floor before they went to sleep in the barn on some bales of straw he showed them. When they woke up in the morning, the oldest brother had a bag of gold under his head. He thought the farmer wanted to test their honesty, and gave him the bag. The farmer took the gold and wanted to keep the boy with him, but the two brothers said they wanted to try their luck further, and left the farm.
On the second night they got overnight shelter at another farm, and the same thing happened as before. This farmer gave them some of the gold coins in the bag to have something on the way. They thought they had got just some worthless coins, so they did not try to buy anything with them on their way that day.
By now they had started to wonder whether there was something weird about the bag and decided to sleep in a corn field the third night. When they woke up next morning, there was a bag with much gold in it under the older boy's head. This time they kept the gold themselves, for they saw no one else around, and besides they thought the coins were worthless.
After a while they came to a town. It was after school, and the school boys were talking with one another in the street and playing with coins. The two brothers asked if they could join in playing, they too. The other boys let them join. The two boys lost all their coins to the son of a merchant. The winner went joyfully home and showed the coins to his father. The father asked him very soon where he had got the coins, for they were of gold. When his son told him he had won them from two beggar boys, the father though they had stolen the money and went to look for them. He found them on the road.
The merchant took the boys with him home, and when he found out how they had got the gold, he kept them as his adopted children. And each morning he found a bag of gold pieces under the head of the eldest of the two boys, so in a short time he was the richest man in town.
The boys were very diligent, and the oldest soon took it so far that the merchant gave him a job in his business, to learn the trade and keep the gold coming.
Now the king of the country had died without an heir. The officials of the kingdom issued orders in the city that all young men between 18 and 24 years should come on a particular day to the town hall. A dove would be released as they were gathered there, and if she settled on any had, that one would be the new king of the country.
The young men came on the appointed day and were all dressed up for the great event. The dove was let out, but she did not settle on any of them, but fluttered restlessly in the hall.
"Are all young men here?" the officials asked, and when they looked closely they discovered that the two adopted children of the merchant were missing. The two boys were sent for, and the dove at once came and settled on the head of the youngest one, and there she would stay.
In this way the youngest of the brothers became the king of the country, and his eldest brother left the merchant and soon was the richest of all there for as long as he lived, as he came to loads of riches while sleeping.

A little girl at times got a dish of milk and a hard roll as a between-meal by her mother. The girl sat down in the yard outside with her little feast. And as the child calmly and delightfully ate and drank, came a grass snake that lived in the farmstead, and sat down near her, and crept ever nearer. Probably the grass snake smelt the food and was hungry. And the animal-loving girl let the grass snake sponge unhindered.
The trust shown by the grass snake made the girl so happy that from now on, if she had something eatable, the grass snake said:
"We two love the food your mother makes."
And the grass snake was never missing and ate so much that it had to be more careful, so as not to overeat. But the grass snake also showed how grateful he was. He brought a precious jewel from his secret treasure to the girl, and beads and golden decorations of marvellous splendour. Because of the gifts the girl grew more beautiful and bright.
The girl's mother did not know anything about the friendship between her child and the grass snake. One day she was frightened to see how the animal coiled itself in the lap of her daughter. And since the mother got scared and feared the grass snake might harm her daughter, she grasped it and dashed it against the stone floor till it lay dead.
Afterwards a sad change came over the girl. She grew so ill that the night swallows called to her and the robin brought her dead leaves. Then one early morning, when the mother came to look after her child, she had passed away.

Once there was a cobbler who was very poor, for he had nothing but a wife and an old she-goat. He could earn nothing more at home, and therefore decided to journey forth. "Listen, dear wife," he said one day to her; "you see that I can earn nothing here, so therefore I go away tomorrow. Kill our goat that I may have something to eat along the way."
Next day the goat was killed, the cobbler took a part of it, and went on his journey. He travelled all day and could reach neither village nor town. Tired out, the poor man lay down under a statue standing at the end of the road in order to rest there a little while. Just as he was about to eat the meat the statue began to speak, and asked the cobbler, "What have you got in your bundle?"
"A piece of goat's flesh," was the astonished answer.
"Do you see the little wooden hut at the end of the road?"
"Yes, I see it," he answered.
"Go there and cast in your meat. The devils have their workshop there. If afterwards they ask you what you demand as payment, answer, "The old rag that lies on the bed."
The cobbler then went to the hut, cast in the flesh, and demanded as payment the rag that the statue had spoken of. Only after long parleying did he get it. He then went back with it, looking at his acquisition; but no matter how he looked at it, the rag was much worse than any rag he had at home.
The cobbler came back to the statue and told he was disappointed with the advice. But the statue said, "Take this little rod out of my hand and tap three times on your rag with it."
The cobbler did so, and at once the best dishes were served on the rag. The cobbler who had not tasted such food for long, could once more enjoy himself. After the meal was finished he thanked the statue, took his rag, and wanted to go home again.
On the way, however, he passed the night in an inn, and showed the magical rag to the guests there. The host and the hostess admired it, and in their hearts longed to have it. In the night the host stole the cobbler's magical rag from him, and placed another instead by his bedside.
Next day the cobbler paid the innkeeper his reckoning and went homeward with the rag he imagined was his own. When he got home, he invited all his friends to a merry feast. Many guests came and expected to be served many dishes, as the custom was for feasts. Then he cobbler joined the company, with his rag in his hand, and told them what had happened to him the last few days. Having done so, the cobbler took out the rod, and struck slowly and steadily three times on the rag. But no dishes appeared. The cobbler struck repeatedly and even more violently, but the rag remained as it was, and the hungry company had to go away unsatisfied. And the poor man very soon came to think that the statue was the cause of the misfortune.
Soon after the cobbler undertook his second journey, and again took a piece of the goat's flesh with him. Again he came to the statue. This time it asked him to give the flesh to the devils and to demand in return the old goat that was hung up at the door. The cobbler did so, and got a she-goat. She was much more wretched than the one he had slaughtered before setting out.
When he came to the statue he complained very sorely to it. But the statue gave him a rod, and bade the man to strike with it on the back of the goat. The cobbler did so, and to his surprise gold pieces fell from the ears of the animal. The cobbler got glad when he saw the money. Quickly he thanked the statue and hastened homeward with the old goat.
On the way, however, he got hungry and thirsty, and therefore turned in to the very inn where he had stopped before. After having eaten and drunk, he was about to pay his reckoning. Then he led the goat into the room and struck three times with the rod on its back. The goat shook money out of its ears, and the cobbler paid his reckoning with it. No sooner did the host observe this than he began to plan how he might get the goat too.
The innkeeper also had a goat which looked like the goat that the cobbler had. So he decided to switch goats during the night. And so it happened. The goats were changed.
When the cobbler woke up next morning, he was in good spirits and had not the slightest suspicion of the trick that had been played on him.
When he came home, his wife had to go and fetch a roast pig and make preparations for a costly meal. He would give her the money for it later. When the meal was eaten, the cobbler led the goat into the room and struck with the rod thrice on the back of the animal. But no money fell from the goat. The cobbler struck more and more violently, but still no money. All attempts were in vain; the beast sadly shook his head, but no gold fell from his ears. Only a weak moan from the poor ill-used animal broke the mysterious silence.
The cobbler now thought he had been tricked a second time, and soon undertook his third journey. Again he took a piece of goat's flesh with him.
Again he went to the statue, and again it advised him to give the flesh to the devils - and to demand in return the old hat standing by the bed. The cobbler did as he was counselled and got the old hat. It was in a very poor condition.
When the cobbler came back to the statue he was given a third rod. He was to knock three times on the hat with it. He did, and to his astonishment an army of tiny soldiers marched out. He gazed with delight on this little army; then struck on the hat again, and all the soldiers went in.
The statue explained to the cobbler that his other magical articles had been stolen by the innkeeper. The cobbler determined to fetch them and after thanking the statue went to the inn. Arrived there he demanded of the host the rag and the goat. But the host would not give them back. Then the cobbler knocked on his hat, and then the whole tap-room overflowed with soldiers who threatened the host with death if he did not give up those articles. Full of terror the host gave them up, and the cobbler returned a richer man to his house.
As he drew near to his home, he sent to invite the king of the land, and promised to show him all manner of things. The king came, saw the goat and the rag, and the dishes on the table. They were quite to his taste. But when he left, he ordered his servants to steal both the rag and the goat. This was done.
In vain the cobbler asked for his property. The king only laughed at him. Then the cobbler, relying on the hat, declared war against the king, and the king accepted it laughingly. The two set the place and time of the battle. When the day arrived the cobbler was the first on the battle-field; soon the king also appeared with ten of his best soldiers.
As soon as the cobbler saw them, he made his army march out of the hat, and commanded them to take the king and the others captive. The king was quite amazed at the army, and was about to run away, for he felt himself too weak; but the hosts of his foes had already surrounded him. He had to yield, and he was led to the cobbler. The latter promised him pardon as soon as he should restore the goat and the rag.
In this way a king was overcome by an ill-used cobbler who had taken advice from a statue.

Long, long ago, there were brave fighters and skilful hunters in Holland, but neither men nor women ever dreamed that food was to be got out of the ground, but only from the trees and bushes, such as berries, acorns and honey. They thought the crust of the earth was too hard to be broken up for seed, even if they knew what grain and bread were. They supposed that what nature provided in the forest was the only food for men. Besides this, they made their women do all the work and cook the acorns and brew the honey into mead, while they went out to fish and hunt and fight.
So the fairies took pity on the cold, northern people, who lived where it rained and snowed a great deal. They held a council and agreed that it was time to send down to the earth an animal, with tusks, to tear up the ground. Then the people would see the riches of the earth and learn what soil was. They would be blessed with farms and gardens, barns and stalls, hay and grain, horses and cattle, wheat and barley, pigs and clover.
Now there were powerful fairies, of a certain kind, who lived in a Happy Land far, far away, who had charge of everything in the air and water. One of them was named Fro, who became lord of the summer sunshine and warm showers, that make all things grow. It was in this bright region that the white elves lived.
It was a pretty custom in fairy-land that when a fairy baby cut its first tooth, the mothers friends should make the little one some pretty present.
When Nerthus, the mother of the infant Fro, looked into its mouth and saw the little white thing that had come up through the babys gums, she went in great glee and told the glad news to all the other fairies. It was a great event and she tried to guess what present her wonderful boy-baby should receive.
There was one giant-like fairy as strong as a polar bear, who agreed to get, for little Fro, a creature that could put his nose under the sod and root up the ground. In this way he would show men what the earth, just under its surface, contained, without their going into mines and caverns.
One day this giant fairy heard two stout dwarfs talking loudly in the region under the earth. They were boasting as to which could beat the other at the fire and bellows, for both were blacksmiths. One was the king of the dwarfs, who made a bet that he could excel the other. So he set them to work as rivals, while a third dwarf worked the bellows. The dwarf-king threw some gold in the flames to melt; but, fearing he might not win the bet, he went away to get other fairies to help him. He told the bellows dwarf to keep on pumping air on the fire, no matter what might happen to him.
So when one giant fairy, in the form of a gadfly, flew at him, and bit him in the hand, the bellows-blower did not stop for the pain, but kept on until the fire roared loudly, as to make the cavern echo. Then all the gold melted and could be transformed. As soon as the dwarf-king came back, the bellows-blower took up the tongs and drew out of the fire a boar having golden bristles.
This fire-born golden boar had the power of travelling through the air as swiftly as a streak of lightning. It was named Gullin, or Golden, and was given to the fairy Fro, and he, when grown, used the wonderful creature as his steed. All the other good fairies and the elves rejoiced, because men on the earth would now be helped to do great things.
Even more wonderful to tell, this fire-born creature became the father of all the animals that have tusks and that roam in the woods. A tusk is a big tooth, of which the hardest and sharpest part grows, long and sharp, outside of the mouth and it stays there, even when the mouth is shut.
When Gullin was not occupied, or being ridden by Fro on his errands over the world, he taught his sons, that is, the wild boars of the forest, how to root up the ground and make it soft for things to grow in. Then his master Fro sent the sunbeams and the warm showers to make the turned-up earth fruitful.
To do this, the wild boars were given two long tusks, as pointed as needles and sharp as knives. With one sweep of his head a boar could rip open a dog or a wolf, a bull or a bear, or furrow the earth like a ploughshare.
Now there were several cousins in the Tusk family. The elephant on land, and the walrus and narwhal in the seas; but none of these could plough ground, but because the boars tusks grew out so long and were so sharp, and hooked at the end, it could tear open the earths hard crust and root up the ground. This made a soil fit for tender plants to grow in, and even the wild flowers sprang up in them.
All this, when they first noticed it, was very wonderful to human beings. The children called one to the other to come and see the unusual sight. The little troughs, made first by the ripping of the boars tusks, were widened by rooting with their snouts. These were welcomed by the birds, for they hopped into the lines thus made, to feed on the worms. So the birds, supposing that these little gutters in the ground were made especially for them, made great friends with the boars. They would even perch near by, or fly to their backs, and ride on them.
As for the men fathers, when they looked at the clods and the loose earth thus turned over, they found them to be very soft. So the women and girls were able to break them up with their sticks. Then the seeds, dropped by the birds that came flying back every spring time, from far-away lands, sprouted. It was noticed that new kinds of plants grew up, which had stalks. In the heads or ears of these were a hundredfold more seeds. When the children tasted them, they found, to their delight, that the little grains were good to eat. They swallowed them whole, they roasted them at the fire, or they pounded them with stones. Then they baked the meal thus made or made it into mush, eating it with honey.
For the first time people in the Dutch world had bread. When they added the honey, brought by the bees, they had sweet cakes with mead. Then, saving the seeds over, from one summer to another, they in the spring time planted them in the little trenches made by the animals tusks. Then the Dutch words for boar and row were put together, meaning boar row, and there issued, in time, our word furrow.
The women were the first to become skilful in baking. In the beginning they used hot stones on which to lay the lump of meal, or flour and water, or the batter. Then having learned about yeast, which raised the flour, that is, lifted it up, with gas and bubbles, they made real bread and cakes and baked them in the ovens which the men had made. When they put a slice of meat between upper and lower layers of bread, they called it broodje, that is, little bread; or, sandwich. In time, instead of one kind of bread, or cake, they had a dozen or twenty different sorts, besides griddle cakes and waffles.
Now when the wise men of the mark, or neighborhood, saw that the women did such wonderful things, they put their heads together and said one to the other:
We are quite ready to confess that fairies, and elves, and even the kabouters are smarter than we are. Our women, also, are certainly wonderful; but it will never do to let the boars think that they know more than we do. They did indeed teach us how to make furrows, and the birds brought us grain; but we are the greater, for we can hunt and kill the boars with our spears.
Although they can tear up the sod and root in the ground with tusk and snout, they cannot make cakes, as our women can. So let us see if we cannot beat both the boars and birds, and even excel our women. We shall be more like the fairies, if we invent something that will outshine them all.
So they thought and planned, and, little by little, they made the plough. First, with a sharp stick in their hands, the men scratched the surface of the ground into lines that were not very deep. Then they nailed plates of iron on those sticks. Next, they fixed this iron-shod wood in a frame to be pulled forward, and, by and by, they added handles. Men and women, harnessed together, pulled the plough. Indeed it was ages before they had oxen to do this heavy work for them. At last the perfect plough was seen. It had a knife in front to cut the clods, a coulter, a beam, a mould board and handles, and, after a while, a wheel to keep it straight. Then they set horses to draw it.
Fro the fairy was the owner, not only of the boar with the golden bristles, but also of the lightning-like horse, Sleipnir, that could ride through fire and water with the speed of light. Fro also owned the magic ship, which could navigate both land and sea. It was so very elastic that it could be stretched out to carry a host of warriors over the seas to war, or fold up like a ladys handkerchief. With this flying vessel, Fro was able to move about like a cloud and also to change like them. He could also appear, or disappear, as he pleased, in one place or another.
By and by, the wild boars were all hunted to death and disappeared. Yet in one way, and a glorious one also, their name and fame were kept in mens memories. Brave knights had the boars head painted on their shields and coats of arms. When the faith of the Prince of Peace made wars less frequent, the temples in honor of Fro were deserted, but the yule log and the revels, held to celebrate the passing of the Mother Night, in December, that is, the longest one of the year, were changed for the Christmas festival.
Then again, the memory of mans teacher of the plough was still kept green; for the boar was remembered as the giver, not only of nourishing meat, but of ideas for mens brains. Baked in the oven, and made delightful to the appetite, served on the dish, with its own savory odors; withal, decorated with sprigs of rosemary, the boars head was brought in for the great dinner, with the singing of Christmas carols.

In the early ages, when our far-off ancestors lived in the woods, ate acorns, slept in caves, and dressed in the skins of wild animals, they had no horses, cows or cats. Their only pets and helpers were dogs. The men and the dogs were more like each other than they are now.
However, they knew about bees. So the women gathered honey and from it they made mead. Not having any sugar, the children enjoyed tasting honey more than anything else, and it was the only sweet thing they had.
By and by, cows were brought into the country and the Dutch soil being good for grass, the cows had plenty to eat. When these animals multiplied, the people drank milk and learned to make cheese and butter. So the Dutch boys and girls grew fat and healthy.
The oxen were so strong that they could pull logs of wood or draw a plough. So, little by little, the forests were cut down and grassy meadows, full of bright colored flowers, took their place. Houses were built and the people were rich and happy.
Yet there were still many cruel men and bad people in the land. Sometimes, too, floods came and drowned the cattle and covered the fields with sand, or salt water. In such times, food was very scarce. Thus it happened that not all the babies born could live, or every little child be fed. The baby girls especially were often left to die, because war was common and only boys, that grew into strong warriors, were wanted.
It grew to be a custom that families would hold a council and decide whether the baby should be raised or not. But if any one should give the infant even a tiny drop of milk, or food of any kind, it was allowed to live and grow up. If no one gave it milk or honey, it died. No matter how much a mother might love her baby, she was not allowed to put milk to its lips, if the grandmother or elders forbade it. The young bride, coming into her husbands home, always had to obey his mother, for she was now as a daughter and one of the family. All lived together in one house, and the grandmother ruled all the women and girls that were under one roof.
This was the way of the world, when our ancestors were pagans, and not always as kind to little babies as our own mothers and fathers are now. Many times was the old grandmother angry, when her son had taken a wife and a girl was born. If the old woman expected a grandson, who should grow up and be a fighter, with sword and spear, and it turned out to be a girl, she was mad as fire. Often the pretty bride, brought into the house, had a hard time of it, with her husbands mother, if she did not in time have a baby boy. In those days a Herman, a War Man and German were one and the same word.
Now when the good missionaries came into Friesland, one of the first of the families to receive the gospel was one named Altfrid. With his bride, who also became a Christian, Altfrid helped the missionary to build a church. By and by, a sweet little baby was born in the family and the parents were very happy. They loved the little thing sent from God, as fathers and mothers love their children now.
But when some one went and told the pagan grandmother that the new baby was a girl instead of a boy, the old woman flew into a rage and would have gone at once to get hold of the baby and put it to death. Her lameness, however, made her move slowly, and she could not find her crutch; for the midwife, who knew the bad temper of the grandmother, had purposely hid it. The old woman was angry, because she did not want any more females in the big house, where she thought there were already too many mouths to fill. Food was hard to get, and there were not enough war men to defend the tribe. She meant to get the new baby and throw it to the wolves. The old grandmother was a pagan and still worshipped the cruel gods that loved fighting. She hated the new religion, because it taught gentleness and peace.
But the midwife, who was a neighbor, feared that the old woman was malicious and she had hid her crutch. This she did, so that if the baby was a girl, she could save its life. The midwife was a good woman, who had been taught that the Great Creator loves little girls as well as boys.
So when the midwife heard the grandmother storm and rave, while hunting for her crutch, she ran first to the honey jar, dipped her forefinger in it and put some drops of honey on the babys tongue. Then she passed it out the window to some women friends, who were waiting outside. She knew the law, that if a child tasted food, it must be allowed to live.
The kind women took the baby to their home and fed it carefully. A hole was drilled in the small end of a cows horn and the warm milk, fresh from the cow, was allowed to fall, drop by drop, into the babys mouth. In a few days the little one was able to suck its breakfast slowly out of the horn, while one of the girls held it. So the baby grew bigger every day. All the time it was carefully hidden.
The foolish old grandmother was foiled, for she could never find out where the baby girl was, which all the time was growing strong and plump. Her father secretly made her a cradle and he and the babes mother came often to see their child. Every one called her Honig-je, or Little Honey.
Now about this time, cats were brought into the country and the children made such pets of them that some of the cows seemed to be jealous of the attentions paid to Pussy and the kittens. These were the days when cows and people all lived under one long roof. The children learned to tell the time of day, whether it was morning, noon or night by looking into the cats eyes. These seemed to open and shut, very much as if they had doors.
The fat pussy, which was brought into the house where Honig-je was, seemed to be very fond of the little girl, and the two, the cat and the child, played much together. It was often said that the cat loved the baby even more than her own kittens. Every one called the affectionate animal by the nickname of Dub-belt-je, which means Little Double; because this puss was twice as loving as most cat mothers are. When her own furry little babies were very young, she carried them from one place to another in her mouth. But this way, of holding kittens, she never tried on the baby. She seemed to know better. Indeed, Dub-belt-je often wondered why human babies were born so naked and helpless; for at an age when her kittens could feed themselves and run about and play with their tails and with each other, Honig-je was not yet able to crawl.
But other dangers were in store for the little girl. One day, when the men were out hunting, and the women went to the woods to gather nuts and acorns, a great flood came. The waters washed away the houses, so that everything floated into the great river, and then down towards the sea.
What had, what would, become of our baby? So thought the parents of Honig-je, when they came back to find the houses swept away and no sign of their little daughter. Dub-belt-je and her kittens, and all the cows, were gone too.
Now it had happened that when the flood came and the house crashed down, baby was sound asleep. The cat, leaving its kittens, that were now pretty well grown up, leaped up and on to the top of the cradle and the two floated off together. Pretty soon they found themselves left alone, with nothing in sight that was familiar, except one funny thing. That was a wooden shoe, in which was a fuzzy little yellow chicken hardly four days old. It had been playing in the shoe, when the floods came and swept it off from under the very beak of the old hen, that, with all her other chicks, was speedily drowned.
On and on, the raging flood bore baby and puss, until dark night came down. For hours more they drifted until, happily, the cradle was swept into an eddy in front of a village. There it spun round and round, and might soon have been borne into the greater flood, which seemed to roar louder as the waters rose.
Now a cat can see sometimes in the night, better even than in the day, for the darker it becomes, the wider open the eyes of puss. In bright sunshine, at noon, the inside doors of the cats eyes close to a narrow slit, while at night these doors open wide. That is the reason why, in the days before clocks and watches were made, the children could tell about the time of day by looking at the cats eyes. Sometimes they named their pussy Klok-oog, which means Clock Eye, or Bell Eye, for bell clocks are older than clocks with a dial, and because in Holland the bells ring out the hours and quarter hours.
Puss looked up and saw the church tower looming up in the dark. At once she began to meouw and caterwaul with all her might. She hoped that some one in one of the houses near the river bank might catch the sound. But none seemed to hear or heed. At last, when Puss was nearly dead with howling, a light appeared at one of the windows. This showed that some one was up and moving. It was a boy, who was named Dirck, after the saint Theodoric, who had first, long ago, built a church in the village. Then Puss opened her mouth and lungs again and set up a regular cat-scream. This wakened all her other relatives in the village and every Tom and Kitty made answer, until there was a cat concert of meouws and caterwauls.
The boy heard, rushed down-stairs, and, opening the door, listened. The wind blew out his candle, but the brave lad was guided by the sound which Pussy made. Reaching the bank, he threw off his wooden klomps, plunged into the boiling waters, and, seizing the cradle, towed it ashore. Then he woke up his mother and showed her his prize. The way that baby laughed and crowed, and patted the horn of milk, and kicked up its toes in delight over the warm milk, which was brought, was a joy to see. Near the hearth, in the middle of the floor, Dub-belt-je, the puss, was given some straw for a bed and, after purring joyfully, was soon, like the baby, sound asleep.
Thus the cat warned the boy, and the boy saved the baby, that was very welcome in a family where there were no girls, but only a boy. When Honig-je grew up to be a young woman, she looked as lovely as a princess and in the church was married to Dirck! It was the month of April and all the world was waking to flowers, when the wedding procession came out of the church and the air was sweet with the opening of the buds.
Before the next New Years day arrived, there lay in the same cradle, and put to sleep over the same rockers, a baby boy. When they brought him to the font, the good grandmother named him Luid-i-ger. He grew up to be the great missionary, whose name in Friesland is, even today, after a thousand years, a household word. He it was who drove out bad fairies, vile enchanters, wicked spirits and terrible diseases. Best of all, he banished eye-bite, which was the name the people gave to witchcraft. Luid-i-ger, also, made it hard for the naughty elves and sprites that delude men.
After this, it was easy for all the good spirits, that live in kind hearts and noble lives, to multiply and prosper. The wolves were driven away or killed off and became very few, while the cattle and sheep multiplied, until everybody could have a woollen coat, and there was a cow to every person in the land.
But the people still suffered from the floods, that from time to time drowned the cattle and human beings, and the ebb tides, that carried everything out to sea. Then the good missionary taught the men how to build dykes, that kept out the ocean and made the water of the rivers stay between the banks. The floods became fewer and fewer and at last rarely happened. Then Santa Klaas arrived, to keep alive in the hearts of the people the spirit of love and kindness and good cheer forever.
At last, when nearly a hundred years had passed away, Honig-je, once the girl baby, and then the dear old lady, who was kind to everybody and prepared the way for Santa Klaas, died. Then, also, Dub-belt-je the cat, that had nine lives in one, died with her. They buried the old lady under the church floor and stuffed the pussy that everybody, kittens, boys, girls and people loved. By and by, when the cats tail and fur fell to pieces, and ears tumbled off, and its glass eyes dropped out, a skilful artist chiselled a statue of Dub-belt-je, which still stands over the tomb in the church. Every year, on Santa Klaas day, December sixth, the children put a new collar around its neck and talk about the cat that saved a babys life.

Once upon a time, some Dutch hunters went to Africa, hoping to capture a whole family of lions. In this they succeeded. With a pack of hounds and plenty of aborigines to poke the jungle with sticks, they drove a big male lion, with his wife and four whelps, out of the undergrowth into a circle. In the centre, they had dug a pit and covered it over with sticks and grass. Into this, the whole lion family tumbled. Then, by nets and ropes, the big, fierce creatures and the little cubs were lifted out. They were put in cages and brought to Holland. The baby lions, no bigger than pug dogs, were as pretty and harmless as kittens. The sailors delighted to play with them.
Now lions, even before one was ever seen among the Dutch, enjoyed a great reputation for strength, courage, dignity and power. It was believed that they had all the traits of character supposed to belong to kings, and which boys like to possess. Many fathers had named their sons Leo, which is Latin for lion. Dutch daddies had their baby boys christened with the name of Leeuw, which is their word for the king of beasts.
Before lions were brought from the hot countries into colder lands, the bear and wolf were most admired; because, besides possessing plenty of fur, as well as great claws and terrible teeth, they had great courage. For these reasons, many royal and common folks had taken the wolf and bear as namesakes for their hopeful sons.
But the male lion could make more noise than wolves, for he could roar, while they could only howl. He had a shaggy mane and a very long tail. This had a nail at the end, for scratching and combing out his hair, when tangled up. If he were angry, the mighty brute could stick out his red tongue, curled like a pump handle, and nearly half a yard long.
So the lion was called the king of beasts, and the crowned rulers and knights took him as their emblem. They had pictures of the huge creature painted on their flags, shields and armor. Sometimes they stuck a gold or brass lion on their iron war hats, which they called helmets. No knight was allowed to have more than one lion on his shield, but kings might have three or four, or even a whole menagerie of meat-eating creatures. These painted or sculptured lions were in all sorts of action, running, walking, standing up and looking behind or before.
Now there was a Dutch artist, who noticed what funny fellows kings were, and how they liked to have all sorts of beasts and birds of prey, and sea creatures that devour, on their banners. There were dragons, two-headed eagles, boars with tusks, serpents with fangs, hawks, griffins, wyverns, lions, dragons and dragon-lions, besides horses with wings, mermaids with scaly tails, and even night mares that went flying through the dark. With such a funny variety of beast, bird, and fish, some wondered why there were not cows with two tails, cats with two noses, rams with four horns, and creatures that were half veal and half mutton. He noticed that kings did not care much for tame, quiet, peaceable, or useful creatures, such as oxen or horses, doves or sheep; but only for those brutes that hunt and kill the more defenceless creatures.
Since, then, kings of the country must have a lion, the artist resolved to make a new one. He would have some fun, at any rate.
So as painter or sculptor select men and women to pose for them in their study as their heroes and heroines, and just as they picture plump little boys and girls as cherubs and angels, so the Dutchman would make of the cubs and the father beast of prey his models for coats of arms.
Poor lions! They did not know, but they soon found out how tiresome it was to pose. They must hold their paws up, down, sideways or behind, according as they were told. They must stand or kneel, for a long time, in awkward positions. They must stick out their tongues to full length, walk on their hind legs, twist their necks, to one side or the other, look forward or backward, and in many tiresome ways do just as they were ordered. They must also make of their tails every sort of use, whether to wrap around posts or bundles, to stick out of their cage, or put between their legs, as they ran away, or to whisk them around, as they roared; or hoist them up high when rampant.
In some cases, they were expected, even, to put on spectacles, and pretend to be reading, to hold in their paws books and scrolls, or town arms, or shop signs. They must pose, not only as companions of Daniel, in the lions den at Babylon, which was proper; but also to sit, as companion of St. Mark, and even to stand on their legs on the top of a high column, without falling off.
In a word, this artist belonged to the college of heralds, and he introduced the king of beasts into Dutch heraldry.
So from that day forth, the life of that family of African lions, from the daddy to the youngest cub, was made a burden. When at home in the jungle and even in the cage, the father lions favorite position was that of lolling on one side, with his paws stretched out, and half asleep and all day, until he went out, towards dark, to hunt. Now, he must stand up, nearly all day. Daddy lion had to do most of the posing, until the poor beasts front legs and paws were weary with standing so long. Moreover, the hair was all worn off his body at the place where he had to sit on the hard wooden floor. He must do all this, on penalty of being punched with a red hot poker, if he refused. A charcoal furnace and long andirons were kept near by, and these were attended to by a Dutch boy. Or, it might be that the whole family of lions were not allowed to have any dinner till Daddy obeyed and did what he was told, though often with a snarl or a roar.
First, Leo must rise upon his hind legs and look in front of him. This posture was not hard, for in his native jungle, he had often thus obtained a breakfast of venison for his wife and family. But oh, to stand a half hour on two legs only, when he had four, and would gladly have used all of them, was hard. Yet this was the position, called the lion rampant, which kings liked best.
But the kings uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, and his wifes relations generally, every one of them, wanted a lion on his or her stationery and pocket handkerchiefs, as well as on their shields and flags. So the old lion was torturedthe hot poker being always in sightand he was made to take a great variety of positions. The artist called out to Leo, just as a driver says to his cart horse, whoa, get up, golong, etc. When he yelled in this fashion, the lion had to obey.
Pretty soon lions in heraldry, on flags, armor, town arms, family crests and city seals became all the fashion. The whole country went lion-mad. There were lions carved in stone, wood and iron, and every sort and kind, possible or impossible. Some of them seemed to be engaged in a variety of tricks, as if they belonged to a circus, or were having a holiday. They laughed, giggled, yawned, stuck out their tongues, held boards for hotels, bundles for the shopkeepers, or barrels for beer halls, and made excellent shop signs, which the boys and girls enjoyed looking at.
Mrs. Leo was not in much demand, for Mr. Leo did not approve of his wifes appearing in public. She was kept busy in taking care of her cubs. Daddy Lion had to do multiple work for his family, until the cubs were grown. Yet long before this time had come, their Dad had died and been stuffed for a museum. How this first king of beasts in the Netherlands came to his untimely end was on this wise.
Not satisfied with posing Leo in every posture, and with all possible gestures, his master, the artist, wanted him to look heraldical; that is, like some of the mythical beasts that were combinations of any and all creatures having fins, fur, feathers, or scales, such as the dragon or griffin. One day, he attempted to make out of a live lion a fanciful creature of curlicues and curliewurlies. So he strapped the lion down, and used a curling iron on his mane until he looked like a bearded bull of Babylon. Then he combed out, and, with curl papers, twisted the long line of hair, which is seen in front of Leos stomach. In like manner, he treated the bunches of hair that grow over the animals kneepans and elbows. Last of all, he took a hair brush, and smoothed out the tuft, at the end of the animals long tail. Then the artist made a picture of him in this condition, all curled and rich in ringlets, like a dandy.
By this time, the father of the lion family looked as if he had come out fresh from a hairdressers parlor. Indeed, Mrs. Leo was so struck with her husbands appearance, that she immediately licked her cubs all over, until their fur shone, so they should look like their father. Then, having used her tongue as a comb, to make her own skin smooth and glossy, she completed the job by using the nail in her tail, to do the finishing work. Altogether, this was the curliest family of lions ever seen, and Daddy Leo appeared to be the funniest curly-headed and curly-bodied lion ever seen. In fact he was all curls, from head to tail.
Notwithstanding all his pains, the artist was not yet satisfied with his job. He wanted a circle of long hair to grow in the middle of the lions tail. His curly lion should beat all creation, and in this way he proceeded.
His own daughter, being a young lady and having some trouble of the throat, the doctor had ordered medicine for the girl, charging her not to spill any drops of the liquid on her face, or clothes.
But, in giving the dose, either the mother, or the daughter, was careless. At that very moment the cat ran across the room, after the mouse, and just as she held the spoon to her mouth, Puss got twisted in her skirts. So most of the medicine splashed upon her upper lip and then ran down to her chin, on either side of her mouth. She laughed over the spill, wiped off the liquid, and thought no more of the matter.
But a week later, she was astonished. On waking, she looked in the glass, only to shrink back in horror. On her face had grown both moustaches and a beard. True, both were rather downy, but still they were black; and, until the barber came, and shaved off the growth, she was a bearded woman. Yet, strange to tell, after one or two shaves by the barber, no more hair grew again on her face, which was smooth again.
By Saint Servatus! Ill make a fortune on this, cried the artist, when he saw his daughters hairy face.
So, he sold his secret to a druggist, and this man made an ointment, giving it a Chinese name, meaning beard-grower. This wonderful medicine, as his sign declared, would force the growth of luxuriant moustaches and a beard, on the smoothest face of any young man, who should buy and apply it.
Soon the whole town rang with the news of the wonderful discovery. The druggist sold out his stock, in two days, to happy purchasers. Other young fellows, that wanted to outrival their companions, had to wait a fortnight for the new medicine to be made. By that time, a full crop of downy hair had come out on the cheeks and chin and upper lip of many a youth. Some, who had been trying for years to raise moustaches, in order duly to impress the girls, to whom they were making love, were now jubilant. In several cases, a lover was able to cut out his rival and win the maid he wanted. Several courtings were hastened and became genuine matches, because a face, long very smooth, and like a desert as to hair, bore a promising crop. Beard and cheeks had at last met together. So the new medicine was called a match-maker.
The artist rubbed his hands in glee, at the prospect of a fortune. He argued that if the wonderful ointment made beards for men, it must be good for lions also. So again, Daddy Lion was coerced by the threat of the hot poker. Then his tail was seized, and, by means of a rope, tied to a post on one side of the cage, he was held fast. Then the artist anointed about six inches of the middle of the smooth tail with the magic liquid. For fear the lion might lick it off, the poor beast was held in this tiresome position for a whole week, so that he could not turn round, and he nearly died of fatigue.
But it happened to the lions tail, as it did with the young mens chins, cheeks and upper lips. A beard did indeed grow, but once shaved offand many did shave, thinking to promote greater growthno more hair ever appeared again. The ointment forced a downy growth but it killed the roots of the hair.
A worse fate befell the lion. A crop of hair, perhaps an inch longer than common, grew out. But this time, the bad medicine, which had deceived men, and was unfit for lions, struck in.
From this cause, added to nervous prostration, old Leo fell dead. As lion fathers go, he was a good one, and his widow and children mourned for him. He had never once, however hungry, tried to eat up his cubs, which was something in his favor.
Soon after these exploits, the old artist died also. His son, hearing there was still a demand, among kings, for lions, and those especially with centre curls in their tails, took the most promising of the whelps and petted and fed him well. In the seventh year, when his mane and elbow and knee hair had grown out, this cub was mated to a young lioness of like promise. When, of this couple, a male whelp was born, it was found that in due time its knees, elbows, tail-tuft, and the front of its body were all rich in furry growth. In the middle of its tail, also, thick ringlets, several inches long, were growing. Evidently, the hair tonic had done some good. So this one became the father of all the curly-tailed lions in the Netherlands. Not only was this lion, thus distinguished for so novel an ornament, copied into heraldry, but it adorned many city seals and town arms. In time, the lion of the Netherlands was pictured with a crown on its head, a sword in its right hand, a bundle of seven arrowsin token of a union of seven statesand, still later, the new Order of the Netherlands Lion was founded. The original curly lion, with long hair in the middle of its tail, boasts of a long line of descendants that are proud of their ancestor.


Above all countries in Europe, this bird, wise in the head and long in the legs, loves Holland. Flying all the way from Africa, the stork is at home among dykes and windmills.
Storks are seen by the thousands in Holland and Friesland. Sometimes they strut in the streets, not in the least frightened or disturbed. They make their nests among the tiles and chimneys, on the red roofs of the houses, and they rear their young even on the church towers.
If a man sets an old cart wheel flat on a tree-top, the storks accept this, as an invitation to come and stay. At once they proceed, first of all, to arrange their toilet, after their long flight. They do this, even before they build their nest. You can see them, by the hour, preening their feathers and combing their plumage, with their long bills. Then, as solemnly as a boss mason, they set about gathering sticks and hay for their house. They never seem to be in a hurry.
A stork lays on a bit of wood, and then goes at his toilet again, looking around to see that other folks are busy. Year after year, a pair of storks will use the same nest, rebuilding, or repairing it, each spring time. The stork is a steady citizen and does not like to change. Once treated well in one place, by the landlord, Mr. and Mrs. Stork keep the same apartments and watch over the family cradle inside the house, to see that it is always occupied by a baby. The return of the stork is, in Holland, a household celebration.
Out in the fields, Mr. Stork is happy indeed, for Holland is the paradise of frogs; so the gentleman of the red legs finds plenty to eat. He takes his time for going to dinner, and rarely rushes for quick lunch. After business hours in the morning, he lays his long beak among his thick breast feathers, until it is quite hidden. Then, perched up in the air on one long leg, like a stilt, he takes a nap, often for hours.
Towards evening he shakes out his wings, flaps them once or twice, and takes a walk, but he is never in haste. Beginning his hunt, he soon has enough frogs, mice, grubs, worms or insects to make a good meal. It is because this bird feels so much at home, in town and country, making part of the landscape, that we so associate together Holland and the stork, as we usually do.
The Dutch proverb pictures the scene, which is so common. In the same field, the cow eats grass; the grayhound hunts the hare; and the stork helps himself to the frogs. Indeed, if it were not for the stork, Holland would, like old Egypt, in the time of Moses, be overrun with frogs.
The Dutch call the stork by the sweet name Ooijevaar, or the treasure-bringer. Every spring time, the boys and girls, fathers and mothers, shout welcome to the white bird from Egypt.
What do you bring me? is their question or thought.
If the bird deserts its old home on their roof, the family is in grief, thinking it has lost its luck; but if Daddy Stork, with Mrs. Storks approval, chooses a new place for their nest, there is more rejoicing in that house, than if money had been found. Where there are nestlings on the roof, there will be babies in the house, is what the Dutch say; for both are welcome.
To tell why the stork loves Holland, we must go back to the Africa of a million years ago. Then, we shall ask the Dutch fairies how they succeeded in making the new land, in the west, so popular in the stork world. For what reason did the wise birds emigrate to the cold country a thousand miles away? They were so regular and punctual, that a great prophet wrote:
Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times.
Ages ago, there were camels and caravans in Africa, but there was no Holland, for the land was still under the waves. In India, also, the stork was an old bird, that waded in the pools and kept the frogs from croaking in terms of the multiplication table. Sometimes the stork population increased too fast and some went hungry for food; for, the proverb tells us that a stork died while waiting for the ocean to dry, hoping to get a supply of dried fish.
When on the coast of the North Sea, the Land of a Million Islands was made, the frog emigrants were there first. They poured in so fast, that it seemed a question as to who should own the country-frogs or men. Some were very big, as if ambitious to be bulls. They croaked so loud, that they drowned out the fairy music, and made the night hideous with their noises. The snakes spoiled the country for the little birds, while the toads seemed to think that the salt ocean had been kept out, and the land made, especially for them.
The Dutch fairies were disgusted at the way these reptiles behaved, for they could not enjoy themselves, as in the old days. If they went to dance in the meadow, on moonlight nights, they always found a big bullfrog sitting in their ring, mocking them with its bellowing. So when they heard about the storks in Africa, and what hearty appetites they had, for the various wrigglers, crawlers, jumpers and splashers in the waters, they resolved to invite them, in a body, to Holland.
The Dutch fairies knew nothing of the habits of the bird and scarcely imagined how such a creature might look, but they heard many pleasant things about the storks good character. The wise bird had an excellent reputation, not only for being kind to its young, but also for attending to the wants of its parents, when they were old. It was even said that in some countries the stork was the symbol for filial piety.
So the fairies of all the Netherlands despatched a delegation to Egypt and a congress of storks was called to consider this invitation to go west. Messengers were at once sent to all the red-legged birds, among the bulrushes of the Nile, or that lived on the roofs of the temples, or that perched on the pyramids, or dwelt on the top of old columns, or that stood in rows along the eaves of the town houses. The town birds gained their living by acting as street cleaners, but the river birds made their meals chiefly on fish, frogs, and mice.
The invitation was discussed in stork meeting, and it was unanimously accepted; except by some old grannies and grandpops that feared in the strange land they would not be well fed. On a second motion, it was agreed that only the strongest birds should attempt the flight. Those afraid, or too weak to go, must stay behind and attend to the old folks. Such a rattle of mandibles was never heard in Egypt before, as when this stork meeting adjourned.
Now when storks travel, they go in flocks. Thousands of them left Egypt together. High in the air, with their broad wings spread and their long legs stretched out behind them, they covered Europe in a few hours. Then they scattered all over the marshy lands of the new country. It was agreed that each pair was to find its own home. When the cold autumn should come, they were to assemble again for flight to Egypt.
It was a new sight for the fairies, the frogs and the men, to look over the landscape and see these snow white strangers. They were so pretty to look at, while promenading over the meadows, wading in the ponds and ditches, or standing silently by the river banks. Soon, however, these foreign birds were very unpopular in bullfrog land, and as for the snakes, they thought that Holland would be ruined by these hungry strangers. On the other hand, it was good news, in fairy-land, that all fairies could dance safely on their meadow rings, for the bullfrogs were now afraid to venture in the grass, lest they should be gobbled up, for the frogs could not hide from the storks. The new birds could poke their big bills so far into the mud-holes, that no frog, or snake, big or little, was safe. The storks red legs were so long, and the birds could wade in such deep water, that hundreds of frogs were soon eaten up, and there were many widows and orphans in the ponds and puddles.
When the fairies got more acquainted with their new guests, and saw how they behaved, they nearly died of laughing. They were not surprised at their diet, or eating habits, but they soon discovered that the storks were not song birds. Instead of having voices, they seemed to talk to each other by clattering their long jaws, or snapping their mandibles together. Their snowy plumageall being white but their wing featherswas admired, was envied, and their long bright colored legs were a wonder. At first the fairies thought their guests wore red stockings and they thought how heavy must be the laundry work on wash days; for in Holland, everything must be clean.
Of all creatures on earth, as the fairies thought, the funniest was seen when Mr. Stork was in love. To attract and please his lady love, he made the most grotesque gestures. He would leap up from the ground and move with a hop, skip, and jump. Then he spread out his wings, as if to hug his beloved. Then he danced around her, as if he were filled with wine. All the time he made the best music he knew how, by clattering his mandibles together. He intended this performance for a sort of love ditty, or serenade. The whole program was more amusing than anything that an ape, goat, or donkey could get up. How the fairies did laugh!
Yet the fairies were very grateful to the storks for ridding their meadows of so much vermin. How these delicate looking, snow white and graceful creatures could put so many snails, snakes, tadpoles, and toads into their stomachs and turn them into snow white feathers, wonderful wings and long legs, as red as a rose, was a mystery to them. It seemed more wonderful than anything which they could do, but as fairies have no stomachs and do not eat, this whole matter of digestion was a mystery to them.
Besides the terror and gloom in the frog world, every reptile winced and squirmed, when he heard of this new enemy. All crawlers, creepers, and jumpers had so long imagined that the land was theirs and had been made solely for their benefit! Nor did they know how to conquer the storks. The frog daddies could do nothing, and the frog mothers were every moment afraid to let either the tadpoles or froggies go out of their sight. They worried lest they should see their babies caught up in a pair of long, bony jaws, as sharp as scissors, there to wriggle and crow, until their darlings disappeared within the monster.
One anecdote of the many that were long told in the old Dutch frog ponds was this: showing into what clangers curiosity may lead youngsters. We put it in quotation marks to show that it was told as a true story, and not printed in a book, or made up.
A tadpole often teased its froggy mother to let it go and see a red pole, of which it had heard from a traveller. Mrs. Frog would not at first let her son go, but promised that as soon as the tadpole lost his tail, and his flippers had turned into fore legs, and his hind quarters had properly sprouted, so that he could hop out of danger, he might then venture on his travels. She warned him, however, not to go too near to that curious red pole, of which he had heard. Nobody as yet found out just what this red thing, standing in the water, was; but danger was suspected by old heads, and all little froggies were warned to be careful and keep away. In reality, the red stick was the leg of a stork, sound asleep, for it was taking its usual afternoon nap. The frogs on the bank, and those in the pool that held their noses above water, to get their breath, had never before seen anything like this red stilt, or its cross pole; for no bird of this sort had ever before flown into their neighborhood. They never suspected that it was a stork, with its legs shaped like the figure four (4). Indeed, they knew nothing of its long bill, that could open and shut like a trap, catching a frog or snake, and swallowing it in a moment.
Unfortunately for this uneducated young frog, that had never travelled from home, it now went too near the red pole, and, to show how brave it was, rubbed its nose against the queer thing. Suddenly the horrible creature, that had only been asleep, woke up and snapped its jaws. In a moment, a wriggling froggy disappeared from sight into the stomach of a monster, that had two red legs, instead of one. At the sight of such gluttony, there was an awful splash, for a whole row of frogs had jumped from the bank into the pool. After this, it was evident that Holland was not to belong entirely to the frogs.
As for the human beings, they were so happy over the war with the vermin and the victory of the storks, that they made this bird their pride and joy. They heaped honors upon the stork as the savior of their country. They placed boxes on the roofs of their houses for these birds to nest in. All the old cart wheels in the land were hunted up. They sawed off the willow trees a few feet above the ground, and set the wheels in flat, which the storks used as their parlors and dressing rooms.
As for the knights, they placed the figure of the stork on their shields, banners, and coats of arms, while citizens made this bird prominent on their city seals. The capital of the country, The Hague, was dedicated to this bird, and, for all time, a pond was dug within the city limits, where storks were fed and cared for at the public expense. Even to-day, many a good story, illustrating the tender affection of The Hague storks for their young, is told and enjoyed as an example to Dutch mothers to be the best in the world.
Out in the country at large, in any of the eleven provinces, whenever they drained a swamp, or pumped out a pond to make a village, it was not looked upon as a part of Holland, unless there were storks. Even in the new wild places they planted stakes on the pumped out dry land, called polders. On the top of these sticks were laid as invitations for the stork families to come and live with the people. Along the roads they stuck posts for storks nests. It became a custom with farmers, when the storks came back, to kill the fatted calf, or lamb, and leave the refuse meat out in the fields for a feast to these bird visitors. A score of Dutch proverbs exist, all of them complimentary to the bird that loves babies and cradles.
Last of all, the Dutch children, even in the reign of Queen Wilhelmina, made letter carriers of their friends the treasure-bringers. Tying tiny slips of paper to their red legs, they sent messages, in autumn, to the boys and girls in the old land of the sphinx and pyramids, of Moses, and the children of Israel. In the spring time, the childrens return messages were received in the country which bids eternal welcome to the bird named the Bringer of Blessings.
This is why the storks love Holland.

A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master no longer wanted to give him anything to eat and said, "I can certainly make no more use of you, but still I mean well by you, and if you prove yourself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain you. But for now get out of my stable." And with that he chased him into the open field.
The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. There the fox met him and said, "Why do you hang your head so, and go about all alone?"
"Alas," replied the horse, "greed and loyalty do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plow well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out."
"Without giving you a chance?" asked the fox.
"The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that."
The fox said, "I will help you. Just lie down, stretch out as if you were dead, and do not stir."
The horse did what the fox asked, and then the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, "A dead horse is lying out there. Just come with me, and you can have a rich meal."
The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, "After all, it is not very comfortable for you here -- I tell you what -- I will fasten it to you by the tail, and then you can drag it into your cave and eat it in peace."
This advice pleased the lion. He positioned himself, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept completely quiet. But the fox tied the lion's legs together with the horse's tail, and twisted and fastened everything so well and so strongly that no amount of strength could pull it loose. When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, "Pull, white horse, pull!"
Then up sprang the horse at once, and pulled the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew up in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him across the field to his master's door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, "You shall stay with me and fare well." And he gave him plenty to eat until he died.

One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed. Reynard was about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tasty bit of the horseflesh. He sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear, when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass, snatching a piece as he jumped across.
The bear was not slow either. He made a dash after Reynard and caught the tip of his red tail in his paw. Since that time the fox has always had a white tip to his tail.
"Wait a bit, Reynard, and come here," said the bear, "and I'll teach you how to catch horses."
Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trust himself too near the bear.
"When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place," said the bear, "you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush, and then fasten your teeth in his thigh," he said.
Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside, and so he did as the bear had told him. He knotted and tied himself well to the horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth into his thigh.
Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop, so that Reynard was dashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that he nearly lost his senses.
All at once a hare rushed by. "Where are you off to in such a hurry, Reynard?" asked the hare.
"I'm having a ride, Bunny!" said the fox.
The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of his mouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having such a grand ride; but since then the fox has never thought of catching horses again.
That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard. Otherwise, they say the bear is as simple minded as the trolls.

One day a nobleman caught a nightingale and wanted to put it in a cage. But the bird spoke to him:
- Let me go and I will give you a good advice. It may be of use to you some day.
The rich man agreed to let it go.
The nightingale gave him these advices:
- Never be sorry for something that cannot be brought back, my lord. And never trust idle words.
The nobleman heard the advises and let the nightingale go. The bird flew out and said:
- Too bad you let me go. If only you knew about my treasure. I have a huge very expensive gem under my wing. If you had taken it, you would become even richer.
When he heard that, the nobleman began to regret letting bitterly about the bird go, jumped up and tried to catch it.
The nightingale turned towards him and said:
- Now I know, master, that you are a greedy and foolish man: you were sorry for something that cannot be brought back. And you believed my idle words! Look at what a little bird I am. How could I be hiding a large gem under my wing?
And after these words the bird flew away.

Once upon a time there were two brothers. They decided to start venturing from town to town and from village to village to to seek happiness. Along the way they saw an old man with white beard heading towards them.
The old man stopped and asked the boys where they were headed. When he found out he told them:
"I want to help you." He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of golden coins. " Which one of you wants these?" he asked.
"I want them." replied the big brother immediately. The old man hand in his other pocket and pulled out a precious gem, shining like the sun, and asked again:
"Which one of you want to have the gem?
"I want it." hasty answered the big brother and the old man gave him the gem. Then the old man put down the sack he was carrying on his back and said:
"Now who is gonna help me bring this sack to the village?"
The big brother said nothing. On the other hand the little brother pulled up his sleeves and bended down to help him. The old man smiled and said:
"Take it with you, my boy, along with everything that is inside."
"No it's not mine.
" Take it, take it." said the old man. "It's my gift to you."
The little brother opened the sack. And what did his eyes see? The bag was filled with precious gemstones. He stood up to thank the old man, but he was nowhere to be found.

Once upon a time there lived a king who had but one son, and he was called the Kindhearted. When the prince was twenty years old, he asked the king, his father, to let him go traveling. His father fitted him out for the journey, gave him a true servant to guard him, and his fatherly blessing. The prince took leave of his father, mounted a brave steed and went to different countries, to see God's world, to learn many things, and to return home a wiser and a better man.
Once when the prince was slowly riding through a silent field, he suddenly perceived an eagle in pursuit of a swan. The white swan was almost caught by the eagle's sharp claws, when the prince, carefully aiming, fired his pistol. The eagle fell dead, and the happy swan came down and said: "Prince Kindhearted, I thank you for your help. It is not a swan that is thanking you, but the enchanted daughter of the Knight Invisible. You have not saved me from an eagle's claws, but from the terrible magician King Koshchey. My father will pay you well for your services. Remember whenever you are in need, to say three times: 'Knight Invisible, come to my help!'" The swan flew away as soon as it had finished speaking, and the prince looked after it, then continued his journey.
He crossed many high mountains, traversed deep rivers, passed foreign countries, and at last he came to a great desert, where there was nothing to see but sky and sand. No man lived there, no animal's voice was ever heard, no vegetable ever grew there; the sun was shining so brightly and burning so terribly that all the rivers were dried up, their beds were lost in the sand, and there was not a drop of water anywhere. The young prince anxious to go everywhere and see everything and not noticing how dry things were, kept going farther and farther, and deeper and deeper, into the desert. But after a while he became terribly thirsty. In order to find some water he sent his servant in one direction and he himself went in another. After a long time he succeeded in finding a well. He called to his servant, "I have found a means of getting some water," and they both were happy. But their happiness did not last, for the well was very deep and they had nothing with which to reach the water.
The prince said to the servant: "Dismount, I will let you down into the well by some long ropes and you shall draw up some water."
"No, my prince," answered the servant, "I am much heavier than you are, and Your Majesty's hands will not be able to hold me. You take hold of the ropes, and I will let you down into the well."
The prince, the ropes tied around him, went down into the well, drank the cold water, and taking some of it for the servant, pulled the ropes, as a sign for the servant to draw him up again.
But instead of pulling him up, the servant said: "Listen, you, kingly son! From your cradle-days until now you have lived a happy life, surrounded by luxury and love, and I have always led the life of a miserable wretch. Now you must agree to become my servant, and I will be the prince instead of you. If you will not exchange, say your last prayer, for I am going to drown you."
"Do not drown me, my true servant, you will not gain anything by it. You will never find such a good master as I am, and you know what a murderer may expect in the next world."
"Let me suffer in the next world, but I will make you suffer in this one," answered the servant and he began to loosen the ropes.
"Stop!" cried the prince, "I will be thy servant and you shall be the prince. I will give you my word for it."
"I do not believe your word. Swear that you will write down what you promise me, now, for words are lost in the air, and writing always remains as a testimony against us."
"I swear!"
The servant let down into the well a sheet of paper and a pencil, and told the prince to write the following: "The bearer of this is Prince Kindhearted, traveling with his servant, a subject of his father's kingdom."
The servant glanced over the note, pulled the prince out of the well, gave him his shabby clothes, and put on the prince's rich dress. Then having changed armor and horses, they went on.
In a week or so they came to the capital of a certain kingdom. When they approached the palace, the false prince gave his horse to the false servant and told him to go to the stable, and he himself went straight into the throne chamber and said to the king: "I come to you to ask for the hand of your daughter, whose beauty and wisdom are known all over the world. If you consent, you will have our favor; if not, we will decide it by war."
"You do not speak to me in a nice way at all, not as a prince ought to speak, but it may be that in your country you are not used to better manners. Now listen to me, my future son-in-law. My kingdom is now in the hands of an enemy of mine. His troops have captured my best soldiers and now they are approaching my capital. If you will clear my kingdom from these troops, my daughter's hand will be yours as a reward."
"All right," answered the false prince, "I will drive your enemies away. Do not worry if they come to the capital. To-morrow morning not one enemy will be left in your land." In the evening he went out of the palace, called his servant and said to him: "Listen, my dear! Go out to the city walls, drive away the foreign troops, and for this service I will return to you your note, by which you denied your kingdom and swore to be my servant."
The honest Prince Kindhearted put on his knightly armor, mounted his steed, went out to the city walls and called in a loud voice: "Knight Invisible! Come to my help!"
"Here I am," said Knight Invisible, "what do you wish me to do for you? I am ready to do everything for you, because you saved my child from the terrible Koshchey."
Prince Kindhearted showed him the troops, and the Knight Invisible whistled loudly and called: "Oh you, my wise horse, come to me quickly!"
There was a rustling in the air, it thundered, the earth trembled, and a wonderful horse appeared, having a golden mane, from his nostrils a fire was burning, from his eyes bright sparks were flying, and from his ears thick clouds of smoke were coming.
Knight Invisible jumped upon the horse and said to the prince: "Take this magic sword and attack the troops from the left, and I upon my golden-maned horse will attack them from the right."
They both attacked the army. From the left the soldiers were falling like wood, from the right like whole forests. In less than an hour the entire army vanished. Some of them remained upon the spot, dead; some of them fled. Prince Kindhearted and the Knight Invisible met upon the battle-field, shook hands in a friendly way, and in a minute the Knight Invisible and his horse turned into a bright red flame, then into thick smoke, which disappeared in the darkness. The prince returned quietly to the palace.
The young princess felt very sad that evening. She could not sleep and so leaned out of her window, whence she overheard the conversation between the prince and the servant. Then she saw what was going on behind the city walls. She also saw the Knight Invisible disappear in the darkness, and Prince Kindhearted return to the palace. She saw the false prince coming out of the palace, taking the knightly armor from the servant, and Prince Kindhearted entering the stable to rest.
The next morning, the old king, seeing his land freed from the enemies, felt very happy, and gave the prince many rich presents. But when he announced the engagement of his daughter to him, she stood up, took the hand of the real prince, who helped to serve at the table, led him before the old king and said: "My dearest father and king, and all you that are present here! This man is my bridegroom, sent to me by God, for he is your savior, and the real prince. And that one who calls himself a prince, is a traitor; a false and dishonest man." Then the princess told everything she knew and said: "Let him show some proof that he really is a prince."
The false prince gave to the king the note, which was given to him in the well. The king opened it and read aloud: "The bearer of this note, the false and untrue servant of Prince Kindhearted, asks for pardon and expects a just punishment. The note was given to him in the well by Prince Kindhearted."
"Is it really so?" cried the wretch and he became pale as death.
"Yes, read it yourself, if you do not believe it," answered the king.
"I cannot read," said the poor fellow. He knelt before his master and begged for mercy, but he received what he deserved.
Prince Kindhearted and the princess were happily married, and I was present at the wedding feast and also felt happy.

In a voyage which I made to the East Indies with Captain Hamilton, I took a favorite pointer with me; he was, to use a common phrase, worth his weight in gold, for he never deceived me. One day, when we were, by the best observations we could make, at least three hundred leagues from land, my dog pointed. I observed him for nearly an hour with astonishment, and mentioned the circumstance to the captain and every officer on board, asserting that we must be near land, for my dog smelt game. This occasioned a general laugh; but that did not alter in the least the good opinion I had of my dog. After much conversation pro and con, I boldly told the captain that I placed more confidence in Tray's nose than I did in the eyes of every seaman on board; and therefore boldly proposed laying the sum I had agreed to pay for my passage (viz., one hundred guineas) that we should find game within half an hour. The captain (a good hearty fellow) laughed again, desired Mr. Crawford, the surgeon, who was prepared, to feel my pulse. He did so, and reported me in perfect health. The following dialogue between them took place; I overheard it, though spoken low and at some distance:—
Captain. His brain is turned; I cannot with honor accept his wager.
Surgeon. I am of a different opinion. He is quite sane, and depends more upon the scent of his dog than he will upon the judgment of all the officers on board; he will certainly lose, and he richly merits it.
Captain. Such a wager cannot be fair on my side; however, I'll take him up, if I return his money afterwards.
During the above conversation, Tray continued in the same situation, and confirmed me still more in my opinion. I proposed the wager a second time; it was then accepted.
Done! and done! were scarcely said on both sides, when some sailors who were fishing in the long boat, which was made fast to the stern of the ship, harpooned an exceedingly large shark, which they brought on board and began to cut up for the purpose of barrelling the oil, when, behold, they found no less than SIX BRACE OF LIVE PARTRIDGES in this animal's stomach!
They had been so long in that situation, that one of the hens was sitting upon four eggs, and a fifth was hatching, when the shark was opened!
This young bird we brought up by placing it with a litter of kittens that came into the world a few minutes before. The old cat was as fond of it as any of her own four-legged progeny, and made herself very unhappy when it flew out of her reach till it returned again. As to the other partridges, there were four hens amongst them; one or more were, during the voyage, constantly sitting, and consequently we had plenty of game at the captain's table; and in gratitude to poor Tray (for being a means of winning one hundred guineas) I ordered him the bones daily, and sometimes a whole bird.

A Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Toy-goose once wanted to see which of them could jump highest, and so they invited the whole world and everybody else who would like to come, to see the frolic. When the three met together in the room, everyone thought they were remarkable jumpers.
"Well, I'll give my daughter to the one who jumps highest!" said the king; "for it would not be fair to let these people jump for nothing!"
The first one to step forward was the Flea; he had such perfect manners and bowed on every side, for he had noble blood in his veins, and more than that, he associated only with human beings, which makes a great difference.
Then came the Grasshopper; he was certainly very much larger, however, he carried himself well, and wore the green uniform he was born with. Moreover, as he said, he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and was well thought of here at home.
The fact was, when he was brought out of the fields he was put in a house, three storeys high, all made of court-cards with the colored side turned in; both doors and windows were cut out in the waist of the Queen of Hearts. "I sing so well," he said "that sixteen native crickets who had chirped since they were born, and still had no house of cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before out of vexation when they heard of me."
So it was that the Flea and the Grasshopper were able to give a good account of themselves, and saw no reason why they should not marry the princess.
The Toy-goose said nothing; and people thought it was because he knew all the more; the house-dog sniffed at him with his nose, and assured them the Toy-goose was of good family. The old councilor, who had three orders given him for holding his tongue, said that the Toy-goose was a prophet; for one could see on his back if there would be a severe or mild winter, and that was more than one could see on the back of the man who writes the almanacs.
"Well, I shall say nothing," said the king, "however I have my own opinion."
The trial was to take place at once, so the Flea jumped first. He jumped so high that nobody could see where he went to; so they said he had not jumped at all; which was shameful.
The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he jumped right into the king's face, which, the king said was most unpleasant.
The Toy-goose stood still for a long time, thinking to himself; at last the people believed he would not jump at all.
"I only hope he is not ill," said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a side jump right into the lap of the princess, who was sitting on a little golden stool close by.
Then the king said, "There is nothing above my daughter; therefore he has made the highest jump that can be made: to do this, one must have a good mind and the Toy-goose has shown that he has a good mind. He has a mind of his own!"
And so he won the princess.
"It's all the same to me, she may have the old Toy-goose, for all I care," said the Flea. "I jumped the highest; but, in this world a fine appearance is what people look at nowadays."
The Flea then went into a foreign land and enlisted, where it is said, he was killed.
The Grasshopper sat on a green bank, and thought on worldly things; and he said, "Yes, a fine appearance is everything—a fine appearance is what people care about." And then he began chirping his melancholy song from which we have taken this story; and which may or may not be true, although it is printed.

I set off from Rome on a journey to Russia, in the midst of winter, from a just notion that frost and snow must of course mend the roads, which every traveler had described as uncommonly bad through the northern parts of Germany, Poland, Courland, and Livonia. I went on horseback as the most convenient manner of traveling. I was but lightly clothed, and of this I felt the inconvenience the more I advanced northeast. What must not a poor old man have suffered in that severe weather and climate, whom I saw on a bleak common in Poland lying on the road helpless, shivering, and hardly having the wherewithal to cover his nakedness? I pitied the poor soul: though I felt the severity of the air myself, I threw my mantle over him, and immediately I heard a voice from the heavens blessing me for that piece of charity, saying, "You will be rewarded, my son, for this in time."
I went on: night and darkness overtook me. No village was to be seen. The country was covered with snow, and I was unacquainted with the road.
Tired, I alighted, and fastened my horse to something, like a pointed stump of a tree, which appeared above the snow; for the sake of safety, I placed my pistols under my arm, and laid down on the snow, where I slept so soundly that I did not open my eyes till full daylight. It is not easy to conceive my astonishment to find myself in the midst of a village, lying in a churchyard; nor was my horse to be seen, but I heard him soon after neigh somewhere above me. On looking upwards, I beheld him hanging by his bridle to the weather-cock of the steeple. Matters were now very plain to me; the village had been covered with snow overnight: a sudden change of weather had taken place: I had sunk down to the churchyard whilst asleep, gently, and in the same proportion as the snow had melted away; and what in the dark I had taken to be a stump of a little tree appearing above the snow, to which I had tied my horse, proved to be the cross or weather-cock of the steeple!
With long consideration, I took one of my pistols, shot the bridle in two, brought down the horse, and proceeded on my journey.

"That is a terrible story!" said a Hen in a quarter of the town where the affair had not happened. "That is a terrible story from a poultry-yard. I dare not sleep alone to-night! It is quite fortunate that there are so many of us on the roost together!" And she told a tale, which made the feathers of the other hens stand on end, and the cock's comb fall down flat. It is quite true!
But we will begin at the beginning; and that took place in a poultry-yard in another part of the town. The sun went down, and the fowls jumped up on their perch to roost. There was a Hen, with white feathers and short legs, who laid eggs regularly and was a respectable hen in every way; as she flew up on to the roost she pecked herself with her beak, and a little feather fell from her.
"There it goes!" said she; "the more I peck myself the handsomer I grow!" And she said it quite merrily, for she was a joker among the hens, though, as I have said, she was very respectable; and then she went to sleep.
It was dark all around; the hens sat side by side on the roost, but the one that sat next to the merry Hen did not sleep: she heard and she didn't hear, as one should do in this world if one wishes to live in peace; but she could not help telling it to her neighbor.
"Did you hear what was said here just now? I name no names; but here is a hen who wants to peck her feathers out to look well. If I were a cock I should despise her."
And just above the hens sat the Owl, with her husband and her children; the family had sharp ears, and they all heard every word that the neighboring Hen had spoken. They rolled their eyes, and the Mother-Owl clapped her wings and said, "Don't listen to it! But I suppose you heard what was said there? I heard it with my own ears, and one must hear much before one's ears fall off. There is one among the fowls who has so completely forgotten what is becoming conduct in a hen that she pulls out all her feathers, while the cock sits looking at her."
"Prenez garde aux enfants," said the Father-Owl. "That's not a story for the children to hear."
"I'll tell it to the neighbor owl; she's a very proper owl to associate with." And she flew away.
"Hoo! hoo! to-whoo!" they both screeched in front of the neighbor's dove-cote to the doves within. "Have you heard it? Have you heard it? Hoo! hoo! there's a hen who has pulled out all her feathers for the sake of the cock. She'll die with cold, if she's not dead already."
"Coo! coo! Where, where?" cried the Pigeons.
"In the neighbor's poultry-yard. I've as good as seen it myself. It's hardly proper to repeat the story, but it's quite true!"
"Believe it! believe every single word of it!" cooed the Pigeons, and they cooed down into their own poultry-yard. "There's a hen, and some say that there are two of them that have plucked out all their feathers, that they may not look like the rest, and that they may attract the cock's attention. That's a dangerous thing to do, for one may catch cold and die of a fever, and they are both dead."
"Wake up! wake up!" crowed the Cock, and he flew up on to the plank; his eyes were still heavy with sleep, but yet he crowed. "Three hens have died of a broken heart. They have plucked out all their feathers. That's a terrible story. I won't keep it to myself; pass it on."
"Pass it on!" piped the Bats; and the fowls clucked and the cocks crowed, "Pass it on! Pass it on!" And so the story traveled from poultry-yard to poultry-yard, and at last came back to the place from which it had gone forth.
"Five fowls," it was told, "have plucked out all their feathers to show which of them had become thinnest out of love to the cock; and then they have pecked each other, and fallen down dead, to the shame and disgrace of their families, and to the great loss of their master."
And the Hen who had lost the little loose feather, of course did not know her own story again; and as she was a very respectable Hen, she said,—
"I despise those hens; but there are many of that sort. One ought not to hush up such a thing, and I shall do what I can that the story may get into the papers, and then it will be spread over all the country, and that will serve those hens right, and their families too."

Ages ago, when the giants were numerous on the earth, there lived a big fellow named Antigonus. That was not what his mother had called him, but some one told him of a Greek general of that name; so he took this for his own. He was rough and cruel. His castle was on the Scheldt River, where the city of Antwerp now stands. Many ships sailed out of France and Holland, down this stream. They were loaded with timber, flax, iron, cheese, fish, bread, linen, and other things made in the country. It was by this trade that many merchants grew rich, and their children had plenty of toys to play with. The river was very grand, deep, and wide. The captains of the ships liked to sail on it, because there was no danger from rocks, and the country through which it flowed was so pretty.
So every day, one could see hundreds of white-sailed craft moving towards the sea, or coming in from the ocean. Boys and girls came down to stand in their wooden shoes on the banks, to see the vessels moving to and fro. The incoming ships brought sugar, wine, oranges, lemons, olives and other good things to eat, and wool to make warm clothes. Often craftsmen came from the wonderful countries in the south to tell of the rich cities there, and help to build new and fine houses, and splendid churches, and town halls. So all the Belgian people were happy.
But one day, this wicked giant came into the country to stop the ships and make them pay him money. He reared a strong castle on the river banks. It had four sides and high walls, and deep down in the earth were dark, damp dungeons. One had to light a candle to find his way to the horrid places.
What was it all for? The people wondered, but they soon found out. The giant, with a big knotted club, made out of an oak tree, strode through the town. He cried out to all the people to assemble in the great open square.
"From this day forth," he roared, "no ship, whether up or down the river, shall pass by this place, without my permission. Every captain must pay me toll, in money or goods. Whoever refuses, shall have both his hands cut off and thrown into the river.
"Hear ye all and obey. Any one caught in helping a ship go by without paying toll, whether it be night, or whether it be day, shall have his thumbs cut off and be put in the dark dungeon for a month. Again I say, Obey!"
With this, the giant swung and twirled his club aloft and then brought it down on a poor countryman's cart, smashing it into flinders. This was done to show his strength.
So every day, when the ships hove in sight, they were hailed from the giant's castle and made to pay heavy toll. Poor or rich, they had to hand over their money. If any captain refused, he was brought ashore and made to kneel before a block and place one hand upon the other. Then the giant swung his axe and cut off both hands, and flung them into the river. If a ship master hesitated, because he had no money, he was cast into a dungeon, until his friends paid his ransom.
Soon, on account of this, the city got a bad name. The captains from France kept in, and the ship men from Spain kept out. The merchants found their trade dwindling, and they grew poorer every day. So some of them slipped out of the city and tried to get the ships to sail in the night, and silently pass the giant's castle.
But the giant's watchers, on the towers, were as wide awake as owls and greedy as hawks. They pounced on the ship captains, chopped off their hands and tossed them into the river. The townspeople, who were found on board, were thrown into the dungeons and had their thumbs cut off.
So the prosperity of the city was destroyed, for the foreign merchants were afraid to send their ships into the giant's country. The reputation of the city grew worse. It was nicknamed by the Germans Hand Werpen, or Hand Throwing; while the Dutchmen called it Antwerp, which meant the same thing. The Duke of Brabant, or Lord of the land, came to the big fellow's fortress and told him to stop. He even shook his fist under the giant's huge nose, and threatened to attack his castle and burn it. But Antigonus only snapped his fingers, and laughed at him. He made his castle still stronger and kept on hailing ships, throwing some of the crews into dungeons and cutting off the hands of the captains, until the fish in the river grew fat.
Now there was a brave young fellow named Brabo, who lived in the province of Brabant. He was proud of his country and her flag of yellow, black and red, and was loyal to his lord. He studied the castle well and saw a window, where he could climb up into the giant's chamber.
Going to the Duke, Brabo promised if his lord's soldiers would storm the gates of the giant's castle, that he would seek out and fight the ruffian. While they battered down the gates, he would climb the walls. "He's nothing but a 'bulle-wak'" (a bully and a boaster), said Brabo, "and we ought to call him that, instead of Antigonus."
The Duke agreed. On a dark night, one thousand of his best men-at-arms were marched with their banners, but with no drums or trumpets, or anything that could make a noise and alarm the watchmen.
Reaching a wood full of big trees near the castle, they waited till after midnight. All the dogs in the town and country, for five miles around, were seized and put into barns, so as not to bark and wake the giant up. They were given plenty to eat, so that they quickly fell asleep and were perfectly quiet.
At the given signal, hundreds of men holding ship's masts, or tree trunks, marched against the gates. They punched and pounded and at last smashed the iron-bound timbers and rushed in. After overcoming the garrison, they lighted candles, and unlocking the dungeons, went down and set the poor half-starved captives free. Some of them pale, haggard and thin as hop poles, could hardly stand. About the same time, the barn doors where the dogs had been kept, were thrown open. In full cry, a regiment of the animals, from puppies to hounds, were at once out, barking, baying, and yelping, as if they knew what was going on and wanted to see the fun.
But where was the giant? None of the captains could find him. Not one of the prisoners or the garrison could tell where he had hid.
But Brabo knew that the big fellow, Antigonus, was not at all brave, but really only a bully and a coward. So the lad was not afraid. Some of his comrades outside helped him to set up a tall ladder against the wall. Then, while all the watchers and men-at-arms inside, had gone away to defend the gates, Brabo climbed into the castle, through a slit in the thick wall. This had been cut out, like a window, for the bow-and-arrow men, and was usually occupied by a sentinel. Sword in hand, Brabo made for the giant's own room. Glaring at the youth, the big fellow seized his club and brought it down with such force that it went through the wooden floor. But Brabo dodged the blow and, in a trice, made a sweep with his sword. Cutting off the giant's head, he threw it out the window. It had hardly touched the ground, before the dogs arrived. One of the largest of these ran away with the trophy and the big, hairy noddle of the bully was never found again.
But the giant's huge hands! Ah, they were cut off by Brabo, who stood on the very top of the highest tower, while all below looked up and cheered. Brabo laid one big hand on top of the other, as the giant used to do, when he cut off the hands of captains. He took first the right hand and then the left hand and threw them, one at a time, into the river.
A pretty sight now revealed the fact that the people knew what had been going on and were proud of Brabo's valor. In a moment, every house in Antwerp showed lighted candles, and the city was illuminated. Issuing from the gates came a company of maidens. They were dressed in white, but their leader was robed in yellow, red, and black, the colors of the Brabant flag. They all sang in chorus the praises of Brabo their hero.
"Let us now drop the term of disgrace to the city--that of the Hand-Throwing and give it a new name," said one of the leading men of Antwerp.
"No," said the chief ruler, "let us rather keep the name, and, more than ever, invite all peaceful ships to come again, 'an-'t-werf' (at the wharf), as of old. Then, let the arms of Antwerp be two red hands above a castle."
"Agreed," cried the citizens with a great shout. The Duke of Brabant approved and gave new privileges to the city, on account of Brabo's bravery. So, from high to low, all rejoiced to honor their hero, who was richly rewarded.
After this, thousands of ships, from many countries, loaded or unloaded their cargoes on the wharves, or sailed peacefully by. Antwerp excelled all seaports and became very rich again. Her people loved their native city so dearly, that they coined the proverb "All the world is a ring, and Antwerp is the pearl set in it."
To this day, in the great square, rises the splendid bronze monument of Brabo the Brave. The headless and handless hulk of the giant Antigonus lies sprawling, while on his body rests Antwerp castle. Standing over all, at the top, is Brabo high in air. He holds one of the hands of Antigonus, which he is about to toss into the Scheldt River.
No people honor valor more than the Belgians. Themselves are to-day, as of old, among the bravest.

A hungry fox saw some fine bunches of grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach. So he gave up trying and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, "I thought those grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour."

A man and his wife had the good fortune to own a goose that laid a golden egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough. Imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.

There was once a house that was overrun with mice. A cat heard of this, and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the mice one by one and ate them. At last the mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there. "That's awkward," said the cat to herself: "the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick."
So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead.
By and by a mouse peeped out and saw the cat hanging there. "Aha!" it cried, "you're very clever, madam, no doubt: but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you."

There was once a dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to everyone who came to his master's house. So his master fastened a bell round his neck to warn people of his presence. The dog was very proud of the bell and strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction. But an old dog came up to him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend. You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace."

There was once a charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself. A fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same neighbourhood; and the charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would come and share his house: "We shall get to know one another better that way," he said, "and, besides, our household expenses will be diminished."
The fuller thanked him, but replied, "I couldn't think of it, sir: why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be blackened in no time by your charcoal."

Once on a time all the mice met together in council, and discussed the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat.
After several suggestions had been debated, a mouse of some standing and experience got up and said, "I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach."
This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to adopt it, when an old mouse got upon his feet and said, "I agree with you all that the plan before us is an admirable one: but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?"

A bat fell to the ground and was caught by a weasel, and was just going to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go. The weasel said he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on principle. "Oh, but," said the bat, "I'm not a bird at all: I'm a mouse."
"So you are," said the weasel, "now I come to look at you"; and he let it go.
Some time after this the bat was caught in just the same way by another weasel, and, as before, begged for its life. "No," said the weasel, "I never let a mouse go by any chance."
"But I'm not a mouse," said the bat; "I'm a bird."
"Why, so you are," said the weasel; and he too let the bat go.

A dog and a sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones were finer than those of any other animal. "Well," said the sow at last, "mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world: but yours are born blind."
A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds."
The crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, and the fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see. What you want is wits."

There was once a groom who used to spend long hours clipping and combing the horse of which he had charge, but who daily stole a portion of his allowance of oats, and sold it for his own profit. The horse gradually got into worse and worse condition, and at last cried to the groom, "If you really want me to look sleek and well, you must comb me less and feed me more."

A wolf came upon a lamb straying from the flock, and felt some scruples about taking the life of so helpless a creature without some plausible excuse; so he cast about for a grievance and said at last, "Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me."
"That is impossible, sir," bleated the lamb, "for I wasn't born then."
"Well," retorted the wolf, "you feed in my pastures."
"That cannot be," replied the lamb, "for I have never yet tasted grass."
"You drink from my spring, then," continued the wolf. "Indeed, sir," said the poor lamb, "I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk."
"Well, anyhow," said the wolf, "I'm not going without my dinner": and he sprang upon the lamb and devoured it without more ado.

A peacock taunted a crane with the dullness of her plumage. "Look at my brilliant colours," said she, "and see how much finer they are than your poor feathers."
"I am not denying," replied the crane, "that yours are far more colourful than mine; but when it comes to flying I can soar into the clouds, whereas you are confined to the earth like any dunghill cock."

A cat heard that the birds in an aviary were ailing. So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the birds. "We shall do very well," they replied, without letting him in, "when we've seen the last of you."
A spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood, saw a swallow one fine day in early spring. Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch. A change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp frost which killed the unfortunate swallow.
When the spendthrift saw its dead body he cried, "Miserable bird! Thanks to you I am perishing of cold myself."

An old woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing.
The doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, but every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, so that when he visited her for the last time and the cure was complete, there was nothing left.
When the old woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee. After repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt.
On being brought into court she was ready with her defence. "The claimant," said she, "has stated the facts about our agreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed. Now, he says I am cured; but when my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough to be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other things; but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all."

The moon once begged her mother to make her a gown. "How can I?" she answered; "there's no fitting your figure. At one time you're a New Moon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're neither one nor the other."
A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water. As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him why he grieved. On learning what had happened, out of pity for the woodman's distress he dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost.
The woodman answered that it was not, and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his. "No, that is not mine either," said the woodman.
Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe. The woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly; and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes.
When the woodman told the story to his companions, one of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined to try his luck for himself. So he went and began to fell a tree at the edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop into the water.
Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his axe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had done on the previous occasion.
Without waiting to be asked whether it was his or not the fellow cried, "That's mine, that's mine," and stretched out his hand eagerly for the prize: but Mercury was so disgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the golden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let fall into the stream.

A donkey and a fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together. They hadn't gone far before they saw a lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened. But the fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the lion and whispered in his ear, "I'll manage that you shall get hold of the donkey without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free." The lion agreed to this, and the fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell. When the lion saw that the donkey was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the donkey.

A lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a mouse running over his face. Losing his temper, he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. "Please let me go," it cried, "and one day I will repay you for your kindness."
The idea that such a tiny creature could ever be able to do anything for him amused the lion so much that he laughed aloud and good-humouredly let it go.
But one day the lion got entangled in a net that had been spread for game by some hunters, and the mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the lion free.
"There!" said the mouse, "you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a mouse can help a lion."

A thirsty crow found a pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy. At last she hit upon a clever plan. She began dropping pebbles into the pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird could quench her thirst.
Some mischievous boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and, catching sight of some frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they began to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed several of them.
At last one of the frogs put his head out of the water and said, "Oh, stop! stop! I beg of you: what is sport to you is death to us."

A dispute arose between the north wind and the sun, each claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed to try their powers on a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his cloak.
The north wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling furiously down on the man, and caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself.
Then came the turn of the sun. At first he beamed gently on the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey more lightly clad.

A widow, thrifty and industrious, had two servants, whom she kept pretty hard at work. They were not allowed to lie long abed in the mornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock crew. They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for the cock waking up their mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer. So they caught it and wrung its neck.
But what happened was that their mistress, not hearing the cock crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night.

There was a time in the youth of the world when goods and ills entered equally into the concerns of men, so that the goods did not prevail to make them altogether blessed, nor the ills to make them wholly miserable.
But owing to the foolishness of mankind the ills multiplied greatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though they would deprive the goods of all share in human affairs, and banish them from the earth. The latter, therefore, betook themselves to heaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received, at the same time praying him to grant them protection from the ills, and to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with men.
Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that for the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so be liable to attack from the hostile ills, but singly and unobserved, and at infrequent and unexpected intervals.
Hence it is that the earth is full of ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far away; while goods, alas! comeone by one only, and have to travel all the way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.

The hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own. Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily: and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives.
Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool, intending to drown themselves. On the bank were sitting a number of frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths.
Then one of the older hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, "Stop, my friends, take heart; don't let us destroy ourselves after all. See, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves."

A fox invited a stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup. The fox lapped it up with great relish, but the stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth. Her evident distress caused the sly fox much amusement.
But not long after the stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.

A wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey on a flock of sheep without fear of being detected. So he clothed himself in a sheepskin and slipped among the sheep when they were out at pasture. He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned for the night he was shut in with the rest.
But that very night the shepherd, requiring a supply of mutton for the table, laid hands on the wolf, mistaking him for a sheep, and killed him with his knife on the spot.

A stag, chased from his lair by the hounds, took refuge in a farmyard, and, entering a stable where a number of oxen were stalled, thrust himself under a pile of hay in a vacant stall, where he lay hidden, all but the tips of his horns.
Before long one of the oxen said to him, "What has induced you to come in here? Aren't you aware of the risk you are running of being captured by the herdsmen?"
To which he replied, "Pray let me stay for the present. When night comes I shall easily escape under cover of the dark."
In the course of the afternoon more than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of the cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the stag, who accordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express his gratitude to the oxen.
"We wish you well," said the one who had spoken before, "but you are not out of danger yet. If the master comes, you will certainly be found out, for little escapes his keen eyes."
After a short time, sure enough, in the farmer came, and made a great to-do about the way the oxen were kept. "The beasts are starving," he cried; "here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them." As he spoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the stag lay hidden, and at once detected him. Calling his men, he had him seized at once and killed for the table.

A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk on her head. As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: "The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell. With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry-yard. Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them."
Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head. Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!

The dolphins quarrelled with the whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and had lasted some time without any sign of coming to an end, when a sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends.
But one of the dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a sprat like you!"

A fox and a monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh.
"Why do you sigh?" said the fox. The monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men."
The fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! don't stop at any lie, sir; you're quite safe: I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."

There was once a man who had a donkey and a lapdog. The donkey was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off as an ass could be. The little dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap; and if he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return. The donkey had, it is true, a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm: and before long he became very jealous, contrasting his own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the lapdog. At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts. Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog allowed to do. At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belaboured the silly donkey with sticks and cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating.
"Alas!" he cried, "all this I have brought on myself. Why could I not be satisfied with my natural and honourable position, without wishing to imitate the ridiculous antics of that useless little lapdog?"

A fir-tree was boasting to a bramble, and said, somewhat contemptuously, "You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now, look at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then."
But the bramble replied, "Ah, that's all very well: but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a bramble and not a fir."

Once on a time the Sun was about to take to himself a wife. The frogs in terror all raised their voices to the skies, and Jupiter, disturbed by the noise, asked them what they were croaking about.
They replied, "The Sun is bad enough even while he is single, drying up our marshes with his heat as he does. But what will become of us if he marries and begets other Suns?"

A dog and a cock became great friends, and agreed to travel together. At nightfall the cock flew up into the branches of a tree to roost, while the dog curled himself up inside the trunk, which was hollow. At break of day the cock woke up and crew as usual. A fox heard it, and, wishing to make a breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and begged him to come down.
"I should so like," said he, "to make the acquaintance of one who has such a beautiful voice."
The cock replied, "Would you just wake my porter who sleeps at the foot of the tree? He'll open the door and let you in."
The fox rapped on the trunk. Out rushed the dog and tore him in pieces.

A gnat alighted on one of the horns of a bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the bull, "Do you mind if I go now?"
The bull merely raised his eyes and remarked without interest, "It's all one to me; I didn't notice when you came, and I shan't know when you go away."

Two travellers were on the road together, when a bear suddenly appeared on the scene. Before the bear observed them, one made for a tree at the side of the road and climbed up into the branches and hid there. The other was not so nimble as his companion; and, as he could not escape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. The bear came up and sniffed all round him, but the man kept perfectly still and held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead body. The bear took him for a corpse, and went away.
When the coast was clear, the traveller in the tree came down, and asked the other what it was the bear had whispered to him when he put his mouth to his ear.
The other replied, "He told me never again to travel with a friend who deserts you at the first sign of danger."

A slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruelly treated. In order to avoid being captured he betook himself into the desert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave. It was a lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretched fugitive, the lion himself appeared.
The man gave himself up for lost, but to his utter astonishment, the lion came and fawned on him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing the paw to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could: and in course of time it healed up completely.
The lion's gratitude was unbounded; he looked on the man as his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came, however, when the slave began to long for the society of his fellow-men, and he bade farewell to the lion and returned to the town. Here he was soon recognised and carried off in chains to his former master, who resolved to make an example of him, and ordered that he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theatre.
On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena, and among the rest a lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect; and then the wretched slave was cast in among them.
What was the amazement of the spectators, when the lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight! It was his old friend of the cave! The audience clamoured that the slave's life should be spared: and the governor of the town, marvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.

A flea bit a man, and bit him again and again till he could stand it no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last succeeded in catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said – or rather shouted, so angry was he: "Who are you, you wretched little creature, that you make so free with my person?"
The flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, "Oh, pray let me go; don't kill me! I am such a little thing that I can't do you much harm."
But the man laughed and said, "I am going to kill you now, at once: whatever is bad has got to be destroyed, no matter how slight the harm it does."

A queen bee from Hymettus flew up to Olympus with some fresh honey from the hive as a present to Jupiter. He was so pleased with the gift that he promised to give her anything she liked to ask for. She said she would be very grateful if he would give stings to the bees, to kill people who robbed them of their honey.
Jupiter was greatly displeased with this request, for he loved mankind: but he had given his word, so he said that stings they should have. The stings he gave them, however, were of such a kind that whenever a bee stings a man the sting is left in the wound and the bee dies.

An oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe gale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some reeds growing by the water, and said to them, "How is it that you, who are so frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I, with all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into the river?"
"You were stubborn," came the reply, "and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads."

There was once a blind man who had so fine a sense of touch that, when any animal was put into his hands, he could tell what it was merely by the feel of it. One day the cub of a wolf was put into his hands, and he was asked what it was. He felt it for some time, and then said, "Indeed, I am not sure whether it is a wolf's cub or a fox's: but this I know – it would never do to trust it in a sheepfold."

A farmer's boy went looking for snails, and, when he had picked up both his hands full, he set about making a fire at which to roast them; for he meant to eat them. When it got well alight and the snails began to feel the heat, they gradually withdrew more and more into their shells with the hissing noise they always make when they do so.
When the boy heard it, he said, "You abandoned creatures, how can you find heart to whistle when your houses are burning?"

Two men were travelling together, one of whom never spoke the truth, whereas the other never told a lie: and they came in the course of their travels to the land of apes. The king of the apes, hearing of their arrival, ordered them to be brought before him; and by way of impressing them with his magnificence, he received them sitting on a throne, while the apes, his subjects, were ranged in long rows on either side of him. When the travellers came into his presence he asked them what they thought of him as a king. The lying traveller said, "Sire, everyone must see that you are a most noble and mighty monarch."
"And what do you think of my subjects?" continued the king.
"They," said the traveller, "are in every way worthy of their royal master."
The ape was so delighted with his answer that he gave him a very handsome present. The other traveller thought that if his companion was rewarded so splendidly for telling a lie, he himself would certainly receive a still greater reward for telling the truth; so, when the ape turned to him and said, "And what, sir, is your opinion?" he replied, "I think you are a very fine ape, and all your subjects are fine apes too."
The king of the apes was so enraged at his reply that he ordered him to be taken away and clawed to death.

A pedlar who owned a donkey one day bought a quantity of salt, and loaded up his beast with as much as he could bear. On the way home the donkey stumbled as he was crossing a stream and fell into the water. The salt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so that, when he got on his legs again, the donkey found his load had become much less heavy.
His master, however, drove him back to town and bought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and started out again.
No sooner had they reached a stream than the donkey lay down in it, and rose, as before, with a much lighter load. But his master detected the trick, and turning back once more, bought a large number of sponges, and piled them on the back of the donkey.
When they came to the stream the donkey again lay down: but this time, as the sponges soaked up large quantities of water, he found, when he got up on his legs, that he had a bigger burden to carry than ever.

A shepherd's boy was tending his flock near a village, and thought it would be great fun to hoax the villagers by pretending that a wolf was attacking the sheep: so he shouted out, "Wolf! wolf!" and when the people came running up he laughed at them for their pains. He did this more than once, and every time the villagers found they had been hoaxed, for there was no wolf at all. At last a wolf really did come, and the boy cried, "Wolf! wolf!" as loud as he could: but the people were so used to hearing him call that they took no notice of his cries for help. And so the wolf had it all his own way, and killed off sheep after sheep at his leisure.

A fox fell into a well and was unable to get out again. By and by a thirsty goat came by, and seeing the fox in the well asked him if the water was good.
"Good?" said the fox, "It's the best water I ever tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself."
The goat thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and jumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about, like the fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none.
Before long the fox said, "I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs, and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your horns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too."
The goat did as he was requested, and the fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out, but the fox merely turned and said, "If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again."

A fisherman cast his net into the sea, and when he drew it up again it contained nothing but a single sprat that begged to be put back into the water.
"I'm only a little fish now," it said, "but I shall grow big one day, and then if you come and catch me again I shall be of some use to you."
But the fisherman replied, "Oh, no, I shall keep you now I've got you: if I put you back, should I ever see you again? Not likely!"

A man once went abroad on his travels, and when he came home he had wonderful tales to tell of the things he had done in foreign countries. Among other things, he said he had taken part in a jumping-match at Rhodes, and had done a wonderful jump which no one could beat.
"Just go to Rhodes and ask them," he said; "everyone will tell you it's true."
But one of those who were listening said, "If you can jump as well as all that, we needn't go to Rhodes to prove it. Let's just imagine this is Rhodes for a minute: and now – jump!"

An old crab said to her son, "Why do you walk sideways like that, my son? You ought to walk straight."
The young crab replied, "Show me how, dear mother, and I'll follow your example."
The old crab tried, but tried in vain, and then saw how foolish she had been to find fault with her child.

A certain man hired a donkey for a journey in summertime, and started out with the owner following behind to drive the beast. By and by, in the heat of the day, they stopped to rest, and the traveller wanted to lie down in the donkey's shadow; but the owner, who himself wished to be out of the sun, wouldn't let him do that; for he said he had hired the donkey only, and not his shadow: the other maintained that his bargain secured him complete control of the donkey for the time being. From words they came to blows; and while they were belabouring each other the donkey took to his heels and was soon out of sight.

A farmer, being at death's door, and desiring to impart to his sons a secret of much moment, called them round him and said, "My sons, I am shortly about to die; I would have you know, therefore, that in my vineyard there lies a hidden treasure. Dig, and you will find it."
As soon as their father was dead, the sons took spade and fork and turned up the soil of the vineyard over and over again in their search for the treasure which they supposed to lie buried there. They found none. However, after the thorough digging, the vines produced a crop such as had never before been seen.

A rich man once invited a number of his friends and acquaintances to a banquet. His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite another dog, a friend of his; so he went to him and said, "My master is giving a feast: there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me to-night."
The dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations being made in the kitchen he said to himself, "My word, I'm in luck: I'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days." At the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his friend how delighted he was to have been asked.
But just then the cook caught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange dog in the kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the window. He had a nasty fall, fainted for a while, and afterwards limped away as quickly as he could, howling dismally.
Before long some other dogs met him, and said, "Well, what sort of a dinner did you get?"
He replied, "I had a quite remarkable time: the wine was so good that I cannot remember how I got out of the house!"

At a gathering of all the animals the monkey danced and delighted them so much that they made him their king. The fox, however, was very much disgusted at the promotion of the monkey: so having one day found a trap with a piece of meat in it, he took the monkey there and said to him, "Here is a dainty morsel I have found, sire; I did not take it myself, because I thought it ought to be reserved for you, our king. ill you be pleased to accept it?"
The monkey made at once for the meat and got caught in the trap. Then he bitterly reproached the fox for leading him into danger; but the fox only laughed and said, "O monkey, you call yourself king of the beasts and haven't more sense than to be taken in like that!"

Some thieves broke into a house, and found nothing worth taking except a cock, which they seized and carried off with them. When they were preparing their supper, one of them caught up the cock, and was about to wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and said, "Please, do not kill me: you will find me a most useful bird, for I rouse honest men to their work in the morning by my crowing."
But the thief replied with some heat, "Yes, I know you do, making it still harder for us to get a livelihood. Into the pot you go!"

A farmer was ploughing one day on his farm when he turned up a pot of golden coins with his plough. He was overjoyed at his discovery, and from that time forth made an offering daily at the shrine of the goddess of the Earth.
Fortune was displeased at this, and came to him and said, "My man, why do you give Earth the credit for the gift that I bestowed on you? You never thought of thanking me for your good luck; but should you be unlucky enough to lose what you have gained I know very well that I, Fortune, should then come in for all the blame."

Jupiter had it proclaimed to all the animals that he would offer a prize to the animal who, in his judgment, had got the most beautiful offspring. Among the rest came the monkey, carrying a baby monkey in her arms, a hairless, flat-nosed little fright. When they saw it, the gods all burst into peal on peal of laughter; but the monkey hugged her little one to her, and said, "Jupiter may give the prize to whoever he likes: but I shall always think my baby the most beautiful of them all."

A certain man had several sons who were always quarrelling with one another, and, try as he might, he could not get them to live together in harmony. So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them.
"There, my boys," said he, "united you will be more than a match for your enemies: but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy of those who attack you."

A lamp, well filled with oil, burned with a clear and steady light, and began to swell with pride and boast that it shone more brightly than the sun himself. Just then a puff of wind came and blew it out. Someone struck a match and lit it again, and said, "You just keep alight, and never mind the sun. Why, even the stars never need to be relit as you had to be just now."

The owl is a very wise bird; and once, long ago, when the first oak sprouted in the forest, she called all the other birds together and said to them, "You see this tiny tree? If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small: for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear on it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction."
Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, "Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you."
Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them. But they took no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom.
Hence, whenever she appears, the birds attend on her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.

A donkey found a lion's skin, and dressed himself up in it. Then he went about frightening everyone he met, for they all took him to be a lion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw him coming. Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in triumph. The fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the donkey he was, and said to him, "Oho, my friend, it's you, is it? I, too, should have been afraid if I hadn't heard your voice."

Jupiter granted beards to the she-goats at their own request, much to the disgust of the he-goats, who considered this to be an unwarrantable invasion of their rights and dignities. So they sent a deputation to him to protest against his action. He, however, advised them not to raise any objections.
"What's in a tuft of hair?" said he. "Let them have it if they want it. They can never be a match for you in strength."

A lion, feeble with age and no longer able to procure food for himself by force, determined to do so by cunning. Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick: and whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang on them and devoured them.
Many lost their lives in this way, till one day a fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressed the lion from outside instead of going in, and asked him how he did.
The lion replied that he was in a very bad way: "But," said he, "why do you stand outside? Please come in."
"I should have done so," answered the fox, "if I hadn't noticed that all the footprints point towards the cave and none the other way."

A boy was bathing in a river and got out of his depth, and was in great danger of being drowned. A man who was passing along a road heard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began to scold him for being so careless as to get into deep water, but made no attempt to help him.
"Oh," cried the boy, "please help me first and scold me afterwards."

Once on a time a frog came forth from his home in the marshes and proclaimed to all the world that he was a learned physician, skilled in drugs and able to cure all diseases. Among the crowd was a fox, who called out, "You a doctor! Why, how can you set up to heal others when you cannot even cure your own lame legs and blotched and wrinkled skin?"

A hungry fox found in a hollow tree a quantity of bread and meat, which some shepherds had placed there against their return. Delighted with his find he slipped in through the narrow aperture and greedily devoured it all. But when he tried to get out again he found himself so swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the hole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune. Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was; and, on learning the state of the case, said, "Well, my friend, I see nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink to your former size; you'll get out then easily enough."

A mouse and a frog struck up a friendship, They were not well mated, though, for the mouse lived entirely on land, while the frog was equally at home on land or in the water. In order that they might never be separated, the frog tied himself and the mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread. As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well, bu when they came to the edge of a pool, the frog jumped in - taking the mouse with him - and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure. The unhappy mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the frog. There he was spied by a hawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons. The frog was unable to loose the knot which bound him to the mouse, and thus was carried off along with him and eaten by the hawk.

A boy was gathering berries from a hedge when his hand was stung by a nettle. Smarting with the pain, he ran to tell his mother, and said to her between his sobs, "I only touched it ever so lightly, mother."
"That's just why you got stung, my son," she said; "if you had grasped it firmly, it wouldn't have hurt you in the least."

A peasant had an apple-tree growing in his garden. The tree bore no fruit, but merely served to provide a shelter from the heat for the sparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in its branches. Disappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his axe for the purpose. But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, "If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden."
He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk. A few strokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store of honey. Delighted with his find he threw down his axe, saying, "The old tree is worth keeping after all."

A jackdaw, watching some pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envy when he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself as one of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they enjoyed. So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock; and, so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeon like themselves. But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again. But the other jackdaws did not recognise him in his white dress, and would not let him feed with them, but drove him away: and so he became a homeless wanderer for his pains.

Jupiter was about to marry a wife, and determined to celebrate the event by inviting all the animals to a banquet. They all came except the tortoise, who did not put in an appearance, much to Jupiter's surprise. So when he next saw the tortoise he asked him why he had not been at the banquet.
"I don't care for going out," said the tortoise; "there's no place like home."
Jupiter was so much annoyed by this reply that he decreed that from that time forth the tortoise should carry his house on his back, and never be able to get away from home even if he wished to.

A dog was lying in a manger on the hay that had been put there for the cattle, and when they came and tried to eat, he growled and snapped at them and wouldn't let them get at their food.
"What a selfish beast," said one of them to his companions; "he can't eat himself and yet he won't let those eat who can."

Every man carries two bags about with him, one in front and one behind, and both are packed full of faults. The bag in front contains his neighbours' faults, the one behind his own. Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.

A pair of oxen were drawing a heavily loaded waggon along the highway, and, as they tugged and strained at the yoke, the Axletrees creaked and groaned terribly. This was too much for the oxen, who turned round indignantly and said, "Hullo, you there! Why do you make such a noise when we do all the work?"

A boy put his hand into a jar of hazelnuts, and grasped as many as his fist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he found he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears.
A bystander, who saw where the trouble lay, said to him, "Come, my boy, don't be so greedy: be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to get your hand out without difficulty."

Time was when the frogs were discontented because they had no one to rule over them: so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to give them a king. Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast a log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be their King. The frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and scuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool; but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting on it. Thinking that a king of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one. Jupiter, annoyed at being pestered in this way, sent a stork to rule over them, who no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the Frogs as fast as he could.

An olive-tree taunted a fig-tree with the loss of her leaves at a certain season of the year.
"You," she said, "lose your leaves every autumn, and are bare till the spring: whereas I, as you see, remain green and flourishing all the year round."
Soon afterwards there came a heavy fall of snow, which settled on the leaves of the olive so that she bent and broke under the weight; but the flakes fell harmlessly through the bare branches of the fig, which survived to bear many another crop.

One hot and thirsty day in the height of summer a lion and a boar came down to a little spring at the same moment to drink. In a trice they were quarrelling as to who should drink first. The quarrel soon became a fight and they attacked one another with the utmost fury. Before long, stopping for a moment to take breath, they saw some vultures seated on a rock above evidently waiting for one of them to be killed, when they would fly down and feed on the carcase. The sight sobered them at once, and they made up their quarrel, saying, "We had much better be friends than fight and be eaten by vultures."

A walnut-tree, which grew by the roadside, bore every year a plentiful crop of nuts. Everyone who passed by pelted its branches with sticks and stones in order to bring down the fruit, and the tree suffered severely.
"It is hard," it cried, "that the very persons who enjoy my fruit should thus reward me with insults and blows."

A Man and a lion were companions on a journey, and in the course of conversation they began to boast about their prowess, and each claimed to be superior to the other in strength and courage. They were still arguing with some heat when they came to a cross-road where there was a statue of a Man strangling a lion.
"There!" said the man triumphantly. "Look at that! Doesn't that prove to you that we are stronger than you?"
"Not so fast," said the lion: "that is only your view of the case. If we lions could make statues, you may be sure that in most of them you would see the Man underneath."

A tortoise, discontented with his lowly life, and envious of the birds he saw disporting themselves in the air, begged an eagle to teach him to fly. The eagle protested that it was idle for him to try, as nature had not provided him with wings; but the tortoise pressed him with entreaties and promises of treasure, insisting that it could only be a question of learning the craft of the air. So at length the eagle consented to do the best he could for him, and picked him up in his talons. Soaring with him to a great height in the sky he then let him go, and the wretched tortoise fell headlong and was dashed to pieces on a rock.

A kid climbed up on to the roof of an outhouse, attracted by the grass and other things that grew in the thatch; and as he stood there browsing away, he caught sight of a wolf passing below, and jeered at him because he couldn't reach him.
The wolf only looked up and said, "I hear you, my young friend; but it is not you who mock me, but the roof you are standing on."

A fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get free, but with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could persuade the other foxes to part with their tails also, and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting of all the foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: "They're ugly things anyhow," he said, "and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be always carrying them about with you."
But one of the other foxes said, "My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you wouldn't be so keen on getting us to cut off ours."

Jupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds, and named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when he would select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler. Wishing to look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream, where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers. The jackdaw was there along with the rest, and realised that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was: so he waited till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathers they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer than any of them. When the appointed day came, the birds assembled before Jupiter's throne; and, after passing them in review, he was about to make the jackdaw king, when all the rest set on the king-elect, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the jackdaw that he was.

A traveller was about to start on a journey, and said to his dog, who was stretching himself by the door, "Come, what are you yawning for? Hurry up and get ready: I mean you to go with me."
But the dog merely wagged his tail and said quietly, "I'm ready, master: it's you I'm waiting for."

A shipwrecked man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle with the waves. When he woke up, he bitterly reproached the sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface, and then, when they were well embarked, turning in fury on them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction.
The sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, "Lay not the blame on me, sailor, but on the winds. By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself: but the winds fall on me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me."

A wild boar was engaged in whetting his tusks on the trunk of a tree in the forest when a fox came by and, seeing what he was at, said to him, "Why are you doing that, pray? The huntsmen are not out to-day, and there are no other dangers at hand that I can see."
"True, my friend," replied the boar, "but the moment my life is in danger I shall need to use my tusks. There'll be no time to sharpen them then."

Mercury was very anxious to know in what estimation he was held by mankind; so he disguised himself as a man and walked into a sculptor's studio, where there were a number of statues finished and ready for sale. Seeing a statue of Jupiter among the rest, he inquired the price of it.
"A crown," said the sculptor.
"Is that all?" said he, laughing; "and" (pointing to one of Juno) "how much is that one?"
"That," was the reply, "is half a crown."
"And how much might you be wanting for that one over there, now?" he continued, pointing to a statue of himself.
"That one?" said the sculptor; "Oh, I'll throw him in for nothing if you'll buy the other two."

A hind said to her fawn, who was now well grown and strong, "My son, Nature has given you a powerful body and a stout pair of horns, and I can't think why you are such a coward as to run away from the hounds."
Just then they both heard the sound of a pack in full cry, but at a considerable distance.
"You stay where you are," said the hind; "never mind me" - and with that she ran off as fast as her legs could carry her.

A fox who had never seen a lion one day met one, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he was ready to die with fear. After a time he met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so much as he had been when he met him first. But when he saw him for the third time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and began to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.

A man once caught an eagle, and after clipping his wings turned him loose among the fowls in his hen-house, where he moped in a corner, looking very dejected and forlorn. After a while his cptor was glad enough to sell him to a neighbour, who took him home and let his wings grow again. As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the eagle flew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his benefactor.
A fox observed this, and said to the eagle, "Don't waste your gifts on him! Go and give them to the man who first caught you; make him your friend, and then perhaps he won't catch you and clip your wings a second time."

A blacksmith had a little dog that used to sleep when his master was at work, but was very wide awake indeed when it was time for meals.
One day his master pretended to be disgusted at this, and when he had thrown him a bone as usual, he said, "What on earth is the good of a lazy cur like you? When I am hammering away at my anvil, you just curl up and go to sleep: but no sooner do I stop for a mouthful of food than you wake up and wag your tail to be fed."

A thirsty stag went down to a pool to drink. As he bent over the surface he saw his own reflection in the water, and was struck with admiration for his fine spreading antlers, but at the same time he felt nothing but disgust for the weakness and slenderness of his legs. While he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by a lion; but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his pursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was open and free of trees. But as soon as he came to a wood, he was caught by his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and claws of his enemy.
"Woe is me!" he cried with his last breath; "I despised my legs, which might have saved my life: but I gloried in my horns, and they have proved my ruin."

A dog was crossing a plank bridge over a stream with a piece of meat in his mouth, when he happened to see his own reflection in the water. He thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big; so he let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece. But all that happened was that he got neither; for one was only a shadow, and the other was carried away by the current.

When Jupiter was creating man, he told Mercury to make an infusion of lies, and to add a little of it to the other ingredients which went to the making of the Tradesmen. Mercury did so, and introduced an equal amount into each in turn – the tallow-chandler, and the greengrocer, and the haberdasher, and all, till he came to the horse-dealer, who was last on the list, when, finding that he had a quantity of the infusion still left, he put it all into him. This is why all Tradesmen lie more or less, but they none of them lie like a horse-dealer.

There was war between the mice and the weasels, in which the mice always got the worst of it, numbers of them being killed and eaten by the weasels. So they called a council of war, in which an old mouse got up and said, "It's no wonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battles and direct our movements in the field." Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest mice to be their leaders, and these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw. They then led out the mice to battle, confident of victory: but they were defeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to their holes. All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders, who were so hampered by the badges of their rank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to their pursuers.

The peacock was greatly discontented because he had not a beautiful voice like the nightingale, and he went and complained to Juno about it.
"The nightingale's song," said he, "is the envy of all the birds; but whenever I utter a sound I become a laughing-stock."
The goddess tried to console him by saying, "You have not, it is true, the power of song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty: your neck flashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of gorgeous colour."
But the peacock was not appeased. "What is the use," said he, "of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?"
Then Juno replied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, "Fate has allotted to all their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength, to the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree; but you alone are dissatisfied with your portion. Make, then, no more complaints. For, if your present wish were granted, you would quickly find cause for fresh discontent."

A bear was once bragging about his generous feelings, and saying how refined he was compared with other animals. (There is, in fact, a tradition that a bear will never touch a dead body.) A fox, who heard him talking in this strain, smiled and said, "My friend, when you are hungry, I only wish you would confine your attention to the dead and leave the living alone."

An old peasant was sitting in a meadow watching his donkey, which was grazing close by, when all of a sudden he caught sight of armed men stealthily approaching. He jumped up in a moment, and begged the donkey to fly with him as fast as he could, "Or else," said he, "we shall both be captured by the enemy."
But the donkey just looked round lazily and said, "And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have to now?"
"No," said his master.
"Oh, well, then," said the donkey, "I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any worse off."

Two little frogs were playing about at the edge of a pool when an ox came down to the water to drink, and by accident trod on one of them and crushed the life out of him. When the old frog missed him, she asked his brother where he was.
"He is dead, mother," said the little frog. "A huge creature with four legs came to our pool this morning and trampled him down in the mud."
"Enormous, was he? Was he as big as this?" said the frog, puffing herself out to look as big as possible.
"Oh! yes, much bigger," was the answer.
The frog puffed herself out still more. "Was he as big as this?" said she.
"Oh! yes, yes, mother, MUCH bigger," said the little frog.
And yet again she puffed and puffed herself out till she was almost as round as a ball. "As big as...?" she began, but then she burst.

A poor man had a wooden image of a god and used to pray to it daily for riches. He did this for a long time, but remained as poor as ever, till one day he caught up the image in disgust and hurled it with all his might against the wall. The force of the blow split open the head and quite many gold coins fell out on the floor. The man gathered them up greedily, and said, "You old fraud, you! When I honoured you, you did me no good whatever, but no sooner do I treat you to insults and violence than you make a rich man of me!"

A wagoner was driving his team along a muddy lane with a full load behind them, when the wheels of his waggon sank so deep in the mire that no efforts of his horses could move them. As he stood there, looking helplessly on, and calling loudly at intervals on Hercules for assistance, the god himself appeared, and said to him, "Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and goad on your horses, and then you may call on Hercules to assist you. If you won't lift a finger to help yourself, you can't expect Hercules or anyone else to come to your aid."

A pomegranate and an apple-tree were disputing about the quality of their fruits, and each claimed that its own was the better of the two. High words passed between them, and a violent quarrel was imminent, when a bramble impudently poked its head out of a neighbouring hedge and said, "There, that's enough, my friends; don't let us quarrel."

A lion and a bear were fighting for possession of a kid, which they had both seized at the same moment. The battle was long and fierce, and at length both of them were exhausted, and lay on the ground severely wounded and gasping for breath.
A fox had all the time been prowling round and watching the fight: and when he saw the combatants lying there too weak to move, he slipped in and seized the kid, and ran off with it.
They looked on helplessly, and one said to the other, "Here we've been mauling each other all this while, and no one the better for it except the fox!"

A man once bought a slave with black skin, but his new master thought his colour was due to his late owner's having neglected him, and that all he wanted was a good scrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of soap and hot water, and rubbed away at him with a will, but his skin remained as black as ever, while the poor slave almost died from the sores he got and and the cold he caught.

Two soldiers travelling together were set on by a robber. One of them ran away, but the other stood his ground, and laid about him so lustily with his sword that the robber was relieved to fly and leave him in peace.
When the coast was clear the timid one ran back, and, flourishing his weapon, cried in a threatening voice, "Where is he? Let me get at him, and I'll soon let him know whom he's got to deal with."
But the other replied, "You are a little late, my friend: I only wish you had backed me up just now, even if you had done no more than speak, for I should have been encouraged, believing your words to be true. As it is, calm yourself, and put up your sword: there is no further use for it. You may delude others into thinking you're as brave as a lion: but I know that, at the first sign of danger, you run away like a hare."

A lion and a wild donkey went out hunting together: the latter was to run down the prey by his superior speed, and the former would then come up and despatch it. They met with great success; and when it came to sharing the spoil the lion divided it all into three equal portions.
"I will take the first," said he, "because I am king of the beasts; I will also take the second, because, as your partner, I am entitled to half of what remains; and as for the third – well, unless you give it up to me and take yourself off pretty quick, the third, believe me, will make you feel very sorry for yourself!"

A man and a satyr became friends, and determined to live together. All went well for a while, until one day in winter-time the satyr saw the man blowing on his hands.
"Why do you do that?" he asked.
"To warm my hands," said the Man.
That same day, when they sat down to supper together, they each had a steaming hot bowl of porridge, and the man raised his bowl to his mouth and blew on it.
"Why do you do that?" asked the satyr.
"To cool my porridge," said the man.
The satyr got up from the table. "Good-bye," he said, "I'm leaving. I can't be friends with a man who blows hot and cold with the same breath."

A certain man made a wooden image of Mercury, and exposed it for sale in the market. As no one offered to buy it, however, he thought he would try to attract a buyer by proclaiming the virtues of the image. So he cried up and down the market, "A god for sale! a god for sale! One who'll bring you luck and keep you lucky!"
Before long one of the bystanders stopped him and said, "If your god is all you make him out to be, how is it you don't keep him and make the most of him yourself?"
"I'll tell you why," replied he; "he brings gain, it is true, but he takes his time about it; whereas I want money at once."

An eagle sat perched on a lofty rock, keeping a sharp look-out for prey. A huntsman, hidden in a cleft of the mountain and on the watch for game, spied him there and shot an arrow at him. The shaft struck him full in the breast and pierced him through and through. As he lay in the agonies of death, he turned his eyes on the arrow.
"Ah! cruel fate!" he cried, "that I should perish thus: but oh! fate more cruel still, that the arrow which kills me should be winged with an eagle's feathers!"

A rich man settled next door to a tanner, and found the smell of the tan-yard so extremely unpleasant that he told him he must go. The tanner delayed his departure, and the rich man had to speak to him several times about it. Every time the tanner said he was making arrangements to move very shortly. This went on for some time, till at last the rich man got so used to the smell that he ceased to mind it, and no longer troubled the tanner with his objections.

A hungry wolf was prowling about in search of food. By and by, attracted by the cries of a child, he came to a cottage. As he crouched beneath the window, he heard the mother say to the child, "Stop crying, do! or I'll throw you to the wolf."
Thinking she really meant what she said, he waited there a long time in the expectation of satisfying his hunger. In the evening he heard the mother fondling her child and saying, "If the naughty wolf comes, he shan't get my little one: Daddy will kill him."
The wolf got up in much disgust and walked away: "As for the people in that house," said he to himself, "you can't believe a word they say."

An old woman picked up an empty wine-jar that had once contained a rare and costly wine, and which still retained some traces of its exquisite bouquet. She raised it to her nose and sniffed at it again and again.
"Ah," she cried, "how delicious must have been the liquid which has left behind such a ravishing smell."

A lioness and a vixen were talking together about their young, as mothers will, and saying how healthy and well-grown they were, and what beautiful coats they had, and how they were the image of their parents.
"My litter of cubs is a joy to see," said the fox; and then she added, rather maliciously, "But I notice you never have more than one."
"No," said the lioness grimly, "but that one is a lion."

A viper entered a carpenter's shop, and went from one to another of the tools, begging for something to eat. Among the rest, he addressed himself to the File, and asked for the favour of a meal. The file replied in a tone of pitying contempt, "What a simpleton you must be if you imagine you will get anything from me, who invariably take from everyone and never give anything in return."

A cat pounced on a cock, and cast about for some good excuse for making a meal off him, for cats don't as a rule eat cocks, and she knew she ought not to. At last she said, "You make a great nuisance of yourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake: so I am going to make an end of you."
But the cock defended himself by saying that he crowed so that men might wake up and set about the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very well do without him.
"That may be," said the cat, "but whether they can or not, I'm not going without my dinner." Then she killed and ate him.

A hare was one day making fun of a tortoise for being so slow on his feet.
"Wait a bit," said the tortoise; "I'll run a race with you, and I'll wager that I win."
"Oh, well," replied the hare, who was much amused at the idea, "let's try and see"; and it was soon agreed that the fox should set a course for them, and be the judge.
When the time came both started off together, but the hare was soon so far ahead that he thought he might as well have a rest: so down he lay and fell fast asleep. Meanwhile the tortoise kept plodding on, and in time reached the goal. At last the hare woke up with a start, and dashed on at his fastest, but only to find that the tortoise had already won the race.

A soldier gave his horse a plentiful supply of oats in time of war, and tended him with the utmost care, for he wished him to be strong to endure the hardships of the field, and swift to bear his master, when need arose, out of the reach of danger. But when the war was over he employed him on all sorts of drudgery, bestowing but little attention on him, and giving him, moreover, nothing but chaff to eat.
The time came when war broke out again, and the soldier saddled and bridled his horse, and, having put on his heavy coat of mail, mounted him to ride off and take the field.
But the poor half-starved beast sank down under his weight, and said to his rider, "You will have to go into battle on foot this time. Thanks to hard work and bad food, you have turned me from a horse into a donkey; and you cannot turn me back again into a horse in a moment."

Once time the oxen determined to be revenged on the butchers for the havoc they wrought in their ranks, and plotted to put them to death on a given day. They were all gathered together discussing how best to carry out the plan, and the more violent of them were engaged in sharpening their horns for the fray, when an old ox got up on his feet and said, "My brothers, I know you have good reason to hate these butchers. But, at any rate, they understand their trade and do what they have to do without causing unnecessary pain. And if we kill them, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will inflict great sufferings on us by their bungling. For you may be sure that, even though all the butchers perish, mankind will never go without their beef."

A wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and was carrying it off to devour it at his leisure when he met a lion, who took his prey away from him and walked off with it. He dared not resist, but when the lion had gone some distance he said, "It is most unjust of you to take what's mine away from me like that."
The lion laughed and called out in reply, "It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps, eh?"

A stag once asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, saying that his friend the wolf would be his surety. The sheep, however, was afraid that they meant to cheat her; so she excused herself, saying, "The wolf is in the habit of seizing what he wants and running off with it without paying, and you, too, can run much faster than I. So how shall I be able to come up with either of you when the debt falls due?"

Three bulls were grazing in a meadow, and were watched by a lion, who longed to capture and devour them, but who felt that he was no match for the three so long as they kept together. So he began by false whispers and malicious hints to foment jealousies and distrust among them. This stratagem succeeded so well that before long the bulls grew cold and unfriendly and finally avoided each other and fed each one by himself apart. No sooner did the lion see this than he fell on them one by one and killed them in turn.

A young man who fancied himself something of a horseman, mounted a horse that had not been properly broken in and was exceedingly difficult to control. No sooner did the horse feel his weight in the saddle than he bolted, and nothing would stop him.
A friend of the rider's met him in the road in his headlong career, and called out, "Where are you off to in such a hurry?"
To which he, pointing to the horse, replied, "I have no idea: ask him."

A goat was straying in a vineyard, and began to browse on the tender shoots of a vine which bore several fine bunches of grapes.
"What have I done to you," said the vine, "that you should harm me thus? Isn't there grass enough for you to feed on? All the same, even if you eat up every leaf I have, and leave me quite bare, I shall produce wine enough to pour over you when you get slaughtered."

Two pots, one of earthenware and the other of brass, were carried away down a river in flood. The brazen pot urged his companion to keep close by his side, and he would protect him. The other thanked him, but begged him not to come near him on any account: "For that," he said, "is just what I am most afraid of. One touch from you and I should be broken in pieces."

A hound who had served his master well for years and had run down many a quarry in his time, began to lose his strength and speed owing to age. One day, when out hunting, his master started a powerful wild boar and set the hound at him. The hound seized the beast by the ear, but his teeth were gone and he could not retain his hold; so the boar escaped. His master began to scold him severely, but the hound interrupted him with these words: "My will is as strong as ever, master, but my body is old and feeble. You ought to honour me for what I have been instead of abusing me for what I am."

A nobleman announced his intention of giving a public entertainment in the theatre, and offered splendid prizes to all who had any novelty to exhibit at the performance. The announcement attracted a crowd of conjurers, jugglers, and acrobats, and among the rest a clown who was very popular with the crowd. The clown let it be known that he was going to give an entirely new turn.

When the day of the performance came, the theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the entertainment began. Several performers exhibited their tricks, and then the popular favourite came on empty-handed and alone. At once there was a hush of expectation: and he, letting his head fall on his breast, imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the audience insisted that he showed them the animal. They said he must have it somewhere hidden about his person. He, however, convinced them that there was no pig there, and then the applause was deafening.
Among the spectators was a countryman. He disparaged the clown's performance and announced that he would give a much superior exhibition of the same trick on the following day. Again the theatre was filled to overflowing, and again the clown gave his imitation among the cheers of the crowd.
The countryman, meanwhile, before going on the stage, had hidden a young porker under his smock; and when the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could, he gave it a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly. But they all with one voice shouted out that the clown's imitation was much more true to life. Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said sarcastically, "There, that shows what sort of judges you are!"

A lark nested in a field of corn, and was rearing her brood under cover of the ripening grain. One day, before the young were fully fledged, the farmer came to look at the crop. Finding it was yellowing fast, he said, "I must send round word to my neighbours to come and help me reap this field."
One of the young larks overheard him and was very much frightened, and asked her mother whether they hadn't better move house at once.
"There's no hurry," she answered; "a man who looks to his friends for help will take his time about a thing."
In a few days the farmer came by again, and saw that the grain was overripe and falling out of the ears on the ground. "I must put it off no longer," he said; "This very day I'll hire the men and set them to work at once."
The lark heard him and said to her young, "Come, my children, we must be off: he talks no more of his friends now, but is going to take things in hand himself."

A lion and a donkey set up as partners and went a-hunting together. In course of time they came to a cave where there were a number of wild goats. The lion took up his stand at the mouth of the cave and waited for them to come out, while the donkey went inside and brayed for all he was worth in order to frighten them out into the open. The lion struck them down one by one as they appeared; and when the cave was empty the donkey came out and said, "Well, I scared them pretty well, didn't I?"
"I should think you did," said the lion: "why, if I hadn't known you were a donkey, I should have turned and run myself."

A prophet sat in the market-place and told the fortunes of all who cared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that thieves had broken into the prophet's house, and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on.
The prophet was up in a moment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said, "Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others, but it seems he does not perceive all that is in store for himself."

A young hound started a hare, and, when he caught her up, would at one moment snap at her with his teeth as though he were about to kill her, while at another he would let go his hold and frisk about her, as if he were playing with another dog.
At last the hare said, "I wish you would show yourself in your true colours! If you are my friend, why do you bite me? If you are my enemy, why do you play with me?"

A lion was lying asleep at the mouth of his den when a mouse ran over his back and tickled him so that he woke up with a start and began looking about everywhere to see what it was that had disturbed him.
A fox who was looking on, thought he would have a joke at the expense of the lion; so he said, "Well, this is the first time I've seen a lion afraid of a mouse."
"Afraid of a mouse?" said the lion testily: "not I! It's his bad manners I can't stand."

A trumpeter marched into battle in the van of the army and put courage into his comrades by his warlike tunes. Being captured by the enemy, he begged for his life, and said, "Do not put me to death; I have killed no one: indeed, I have no weapons, but carry with me only my trumpet here."
But his captors replied, "That is only the more reason why we should take your life; for, though you do not fight yourself, you stir up others to do so."

A wolf once got a bone stuck in his throat. So he went to a crane and begged her to put her long bill down his throat and pull it out.
"I'll make it worth your while," he added. The crane did as she was asked, and got the bone out quite easily. The wolf thanked her warmly, and was just turning away, when she cried, "What about that fee of mine?"
"Well, what about it?" snapped the wolf, baring his teeth as he spoke; "you can go about boasting that you once put your head into a wolf's mouth and didn't get it bitten off. What more do you want?"

An eagle built her nest at the top of a high tree, a cat with her family occupied a hollow in the trunk half-way down, and a wild sow and her young took up their quarters at the foot. They might have got on very well as neighbours had it not been for a trickery of the cat. Climbing up to the eagle's nest she said to the eagle, "You and I are in the greatest possible danger. That dreadful creature, the sow, who is always to be seen grubbing away at the foot of the tree, means to uproot it so that she may eat up your family and mine at her ease."
Having thus driven the eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the cat climbed down the tree, and said to the sow, "I must warn you against that dreadful bird, the eagle. She is only waiting her chance to fly down and carry off one of your little piglets when you take them out, to feed her brood with."
She succeeded in frightening the sow as much as the eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk, from which, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by night did she creep out unseen to procure food for her kittens. The eagle, meanwhile was afraid to stir from her nest, and the sow dared not leave her home among the roots: so that in time both they and their families perished of hunger, and their dead bodies supplied the cat with ample food for her growing family.

A wolf was worried and badly bitten by dogs, and lay a long time for dead. By and by he began to revive, and, feeling very hungry, called out to a passing sheep and said, "Would you kindly bring me some water from the stream close by? I can manage about meat, if only I could get something to drink."
But this sheep was no fool. "I can quite understand", said he, "that if I brought you the water, you would have no difficulty about the meat. Good-morning."

A tunny-fish was chased by a dolphin and splashed through the water at a great rate, but the dolphin gradually gained on him, and was just about to seize him when the force of his flight carried the tunny on to a sandbank. In the heat of the chase the dolphin followed him, and there they both lay out of the water, gasping for dear life.
When the tunny saw that his enemy was doomed like himself, he said, "I don't mind having to die now: for I see that he who is the cause of my death is about to share the same fate."

The citizens of a certain city were debating about the best material to use in the fortifications which were about to be erected for the greater security of the town. A carpenter got up and advised the use of wood, which he said was readily procurable and easily worked. A stone-mason objected to wood on the ground that it was so inflammable, and recommended stones instead. Then a tanner got on his legs and said, "In my opinion there's nothing like leather."

A bull gave chase to a mouse that had bitten him in the nose: but the mouse was too quick for him and slipped into a hole in a wall. The bull charged furiously into the wall again and again until he was tired out, and sank down on the ground exhausted with his efforts.
When all was quiet, the mouse darted out and bit him again. Beside himself with rage he started to his feet, but by that time the mouse was back in his hole again, and he could do nothing but bellow and fume in helpless anger.
Before long he heard a shrill little voice say from inside the wall, "You big fellows don't always have it your own way, you see: sometimes we little ones come off best."

A hound started a hare from her form, and pursued her for some distance; but as she gradually gained on him, he gave up the chase.
A rustic who had seen the race met the hound as he was returning, and taunted him with his defeat. "The little one was too much for you," he said.
"Ah, well," said the hound, "don't forget it's one thing to be running for your dinner, but quite another to be running for your life."

A town mouse and a country mouse were acquaintances, and the country mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The town mouse came, and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour. The fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and soon he broke out with "My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me, and I promise you you shall live on the fat of the land."
So when he returned to town he took the country mouse with him, and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates. The country mouse had never seen anything like it, and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided: but before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and someone came in. The two mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Before long, when all was quiet, they ventured out again; but someone else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor.
"Good-bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers; whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."

A lion saw a fine fat bull pasturing among a herd of cattle and cast about for some means of getting him into his clutches; so he sent him word that he was sacrificing a sheep, and asked if he would do him the honour of dining with him. The bull accepted the invitation, but, on arriving at the lion's den, he saw a great array of saucepans and spits, but no sign of a sheep; so he turned on his heel and walked quietly away.
The lion called after him in an injured tone to ask the reason, and the bull turned round and said, "I have reason enough. When I saw all your preparations it struck me at once that the victim was to be a bull and not a sheep."

A wolf charged a fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was brought before an ape to be tried. When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the ape gave judgment as follows: "I do not think," he said, "that you, wolf, ever lost what you claim; but all the same I believe that you, fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials."

There were two cocks in the same farmyard, and they fought to decide who should be master. When the fight was over, the beaten one went and hid himself in a dark corner; while the victor flew up on to the roof of the stables and crowed lustily. But an eagle espied him from high up in the sky, and swooped down and carried him off. At once the other cock came out of his corner and ruled the roost without a rival.

A man caught a jackdaw and tied a piece of string to one of its legs, and then gave it to his children for a pet. But the jackdaw didn't at all like having to live with people, so, after a while, when he seemed to have become fairly tame and they didn't watch him so closely, he slipped away and flew back to his old haunts.
Unfortunately, the string was still on his leg, and before long it got entangled in the branches of a tree and the jackdaw couldn't get free, try as he would. He saw it was all up with him, and cried in despair, "Alas, in gaining my freedom I have lost my life."

A farmer was greatly annoyed by a fox, which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls. So he set a trap for him and caught him. In order to be revenged on him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go. As ill-luck would have it, however, the fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting. It quickly caught fire and was all burnt up, and the farmer lost all his harvest.

A cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and begged the goddess Venus to change her into a woman. Venus was very gracious about it, and changed her at once into a beautiful maiden that the young man fell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards married.
One day Venus thought she would like to see whether the cat had changed her habits as well as her form, so she let a mouse run loose in the room where they were. Forgetting everything, the young woman had no sooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was after it like a shot.
The goddess was so disgusted at seeing this that she changed her back again into a cat.

A crow was filled with envy on seeing the beautiful white plumage of a swan, and thought it was due to the water in which the swan constantly bathed and swam. So he left the neighbourhood of the altars, where he got his living by picking up bits of the meat offered in sacrifice, and went and lived among the pools and streams. But though he bathed and washed his feathers many times a day, he didn't make them any whiter, and at last died of hunger into the bargain.

A stag, blind of one eye, was grazing close to the sea-shore and kept his sound eye turned towards the land, so as to be able to perceive the approach of the hounds, while the blind eye he turned towards the sea, never suspecting that any danger would threaten him from that quarter. As it fell out, however, some sailors, coasting along the shore, spied him and shot an arrow at him, by which he was mortally wounded. As he lay dying, he said to himself, "Wretch that I am! I bethought me of the dangers of the land, whence none assailed me: but I feared no peril from the sea, yet thence has come my ruin."

A fly sat on one of the shafts of a cart and said to the mule who was pulling it, "How slow you are! Do mend your pace, or I shall have to use my sting as a goad."
The mule was not in the least disturbed. "Behind me, in the cart," said he, "sits my master. He holds the reins, and flicks me with his whip, and him I obey, but I don't want any of your impertinence. I know when I may dawdle and when I may not."

A cock, scratching the ground for something to eat, turned up a jewel that had by chance been dropped there.
"Ho!" said he, "a fine thing you are, no doubt, and, had your owner found you, great would his joy have been. But for me! give me a single grain of corn before all the jewels in the world."

A wolf hung about near a flock of sheep for a long time, but made no attempt to molest them. The shepherd at first kept a sharp eye on him, for he naturally thought he meant mischief: but as time went by and the wolf showed no inclination to meddle with the flock, he began to look on him more as a protector than as an enemy: and when one day some errand took him to the city, he felt no uneasiness at leaving the wolf with the sheep. But as soon as the shepherd's back was turned the wolf attacked them and killed the greater number.
When the shepherd returned and saw the havoc he had wrought, he cried, "It serves me right for trusting my flock to a wolf."

A farmer set some traps in a field which he had lately sown with corn, in order to catch the cranes which came to pick up the seed. When he returned to look at his traps he found several cranes caught, and among them a stork, which begged to be let go, and said, "You ought not to kill me: I am not a crane, but a stork, as you can easily see by my feathers, and I am the most honest and harmless of birds."
But the farmer replied, "It's nothing to me what you are: I find you among these cranes who ruin my crops, and, like them, you shall suffer."

A horse, who had been used to carry his rider into battle, felt himself growing old and chose to work in a mill instead. He now no longer found himself stepping out proudly to the beating of the drums, but was compelled to slave away all day grinding the corn.
Bewailing his hard lot, he said one day to the miller, "Ah me! I was once a splendid war-horse, gaily caparisoned, and attended by a groom whose sole duty was to see to my wants. How different is my present condition! I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill."
The miller replied gruffly, "It's no use your regretting the past. Fortune has many ups and downs: just take them as they come if you can do nothing better."

An owl, who lived in a hollow tree, was in the habit of feeding by night and sleeping by day; but her slumbers were greatly disturbed by the chirping of a grasshopper, who had taken up his abode in the branches. She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her comfort, but the grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder.
At last the owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid herself of the pest by means of a trick. Addressing herself to the grasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner, "As I cannot sleep for your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of a lute, I have a mind to taste some nectar I was given the other day. Won't you come in and join me?"
The grasshopper was flattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at the mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted.
No sooner had he got inside the hollow where the owl was sitting than she pounced on him and ate him up.

One fine day in winter some ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got rather damp during a long spell of rain. Before long up came a grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains, "For," she said, "I'm simply starving."
The ants stopped work for a moment, though this was against their principles. "May we ask," said they, "what you were doing with yourself all last summer? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?"
"The fact is," replied the grasshopper, "I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time."
"If you spent the summer singing," replied the ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing." And they chuckled and went on with their work.

One winter a farmer found a viper frozen and numb with cold, and out of pity picked it up and placed it in his bosom. The viper was no sooner revived by the warmth than it turned on its benefactor and bit him fatally. As the poor man lay dying, he cried, "I have only got what I deserved for taking compassion on so villainous a creature."

Two frogs were neighbours. One lived in a marsh, where there was plenty of water, which frogs love: the other in a lane some distance away, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the ruts after rain. The marsh frog warned his friend and pressed him to come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there far more comfortable and – what was still more important – more safe.
But the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move from a place he had become accustomed to. A few days afterwards a heavy wagon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the wheels.

A very unskilful cobbler, finding himself unable to make a living at his trade, gave up mending boots and took to doctoring instead. He gave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all poisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for puffing himself.
One day, however, he fell very ill; and the king of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy. Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it.
Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless. Then the king summoned his subjects and addressed them as follows: "What folly could be greater than yours? Here is this cobbler to whom no one will send his boots to be mended, and yet you have not hesitated to entrust him with your lives!"

A donkey and a cock were in a cattle-pen together. Before long a lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall on the donkey and make a meal of him when the cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow.
Now, if there is one thing that frightens a lion, it is the crowing of a cock: and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled. The donkey was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the lion couldn't face a cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to and donkey: so he ran out and pursued him. But when the two had got well out of sight and hearing of the cock, the lion suddenly turned on thedonkey and ate him up.

The members of the body once rebelled against the belly.
"You," they said to the belly, "live in luxury and sloth, and never do a stroke of work, while we not only have to do all the hard work there is to be done, but are actually your slaves and have to minister to all your wants. Now, we will do so no longer, and you can shift for yourself for the future."
They were as good as their word, and left the belly to starve. The result was just what might have been expected: the whole body soon began to fail, and the members and all shared in the general collapse. And then they saw too late how foolish they had been.

A fly settled on the head of a bald man and bit him. In his eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the fly escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me for just one little bite; what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?"
"Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge," he replied, "for I never intended myself any harm; but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"

A donkey was feeding in a meadow, and, catching sight of the wolf, his enemy, in the distance, he pretended to be very lame and hobbled painfully along.
When the wolf came up, he asked the donkey how he came to be so lame, and the donkey replied that in going through a hedge he had trodden on a thorn, and he begged the wolf to pull it out with his teeth, "In case," he said, "when you eat me, it should stick in your throat and hurt you very much."
The wolf said he would, and told the donkey to lift up his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn. But the donkey suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the wolf a fearful kick in the mouth, breaking his teeth; and then he galloped off at full speed.
As soon as he could speak the wolf growled to himself, "It serves me right: my father taught me to kill, and I ought to have stuck to that trade instead of trying to cure."

At a gathering of all the beasts the monkey gave an exhibition of dancing and entertained the company vastly. There was great applause at the finish, which excited the envy of the camel and made him desire to win the favour of the assembly by the same means. So he got up from his place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he plunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly person, that the beasts all fell on him with ridicule and drove him away.

An ill man was visited by his doctor, who asked him how he was.
"Fairly well, doctor," said he, "but I find I sweat a great deal."
"Ah," said the doctor, "that's a good sign."
On his next visit he asked the same question, and his patient replied, "I'm much as usual, but I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all over."
"Ah," said the doctor, "that's a good sign too."
When the doctor came the third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the ill man said that he felt very feverish.
"A very good sign," said the doctor; "you are doing very nicely indeed."
Afterwards a friend came to see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply:
"My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs."

Two travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of a summer's day. When they came to a plane-tree, they joyfully turned aside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of its spreading branches. As they rested, looking up into the tree, one of them remarked to his companion, "What a useless tree the plane is! It bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all."
The plane-tree interrupted him with indignation. "You ungrateful creature!" it cried. "You come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then, in the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me and call me good for nothing!"

A flea once said to an ox, "How comes it that a big strong fellow like you is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them, while I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink my fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?"
To which the ox replied, "Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to them: they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show their fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck."
"They'd pat me, too," said the flea, "if I let them: but I take good care they don't, or there would be nothing left of me."

The birds were at war with the beasts, and many battles were fought with varying success on either side. The bat did not throw in his lot definitely with either party, but when things went well for the birds he was found fighting in their ranks; when, on the other hand, the Beasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the beasts.
No one paid any attention to him while the war lasted: but when it was over, and peace was restored, neither the birds nor the beasts would have anything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to this day a solitary outcast from both.

A man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two sweethearts, an old woman and a young one. The elder of the two didn't like having a lover who looked so much younger than herself, so, whenever he came to see her, she used to pull the dark hairs out of his head to make him look old. The younger, on the other hand, didn't like him to look so much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out the grey hairs, to make him look young. Between them, they left not a hair in his head, and he became perfectly bald.

One day a jackdaw saw an eagle swoop down on a lamb and carry it off in its talons.
"My word," said the jackdaw, "I'll do that myself."
So it flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a great whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram. It had no sooner alighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it could do was of any use: there it stuck, flapping away, and only making things worse instead of better.
By and by up came the shepherd. "Oho," he said, "so that's what you'd be doing, is it?"
And he took the jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his children. It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it.
"What sort of bird is it, father?" they asked.
"It's a jackdaw," he replied, "and nothing but a jackdaw: but it wants to be taken for an eagle."

A wolf, who had just enjoyed a good meal and was in a playful mood, caught sight of a boy lying flat on the ground, and, realising that he was trying to hide, and that it was fear of himself that made him do this, he went up to him and said, "Aha, I've found you, you see; but if you can say three things to me, the truth of which cannot be disputed, I will spare your life."
The boy plucked up courage and thought for a moment, and then he said, "First, it is a pity you saw me; secondly, I was a fool to let myself be seen; and thirdly, we all hate wolves because they are always making unprovoked attacks on our flocks."
The wolf replied, "Well, what you say is true enough from your point of view; so you may go."

A miller, accompanied by his young son, was driving his donkey to market in hopes of finding a buyer for him. On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, "Did you ever see such a pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!"
The miller thought there was sense in what they said; so he made his son mount the donkey, and himself walked at the side.
Before long they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, "You'll spoil that son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! It'll do him all the good in the world."
The miller followed their advice, and took his son's place on the back of the donkey while the boy trudged along behind.
They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the miller heard them say, "What a selfish old man! He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!"
So he made his son get up behind him. Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the miller whether the donkey he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion. He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell.
"Good heavens!" said they, "with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him. Why, you'd do better to carry him!"
"Anything to please you," said the old man, "we can but try."
So they got off, tied the donkey's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them. This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the father and son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics.
They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the donkey, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned.
And so the unfortunate miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his donkey into the bargain.

A stag, pursued by the huntsmen, hid himself under cover of a thick vine. They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place without being aware that he was anywhere near. Supposing all danger to be over, the stag began to browse on the leaves of the vine. The movement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of them, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a venture into the foliage. The unlucky stag was pierced to the heart, and, as he expired, he said, "I deserve my fate for my treachery in feeding on the leaves of my protector."

A wolf was chasing a lamb, which took refuge in a temple. The wolf urged it to come out of the precincts, and said, "If you don't, the priest is sure to catch you and offer you up in sacrifice on the altar."
To which the lamb replied, "Thanks, I think I'll stay where I am: I'd rather be sacrificed any day than be eaten up by a wolf."

An archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and all the animals fled at the sight of him with the exception of the lion, who stayed behind and challenged him to fight. But he shot an arrow at the lion and hit him, and said, "There, you see what my messenger can do: just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself."
The lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him.
A fox, who had seen it all happen, said to the lion, "Come, don't be a coward: why don't you stay and show fight?"
But the lion replied, "You won't get me to stay, not you: why, when he sends a messenger like that before him, he must himself be a terrible fellow to deal with."

A wolf caught sight of a goat browsing above him on the scanty herbage that grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to get at her, tried to induce her to come lower down.
"You are risking your life up there, madam, indeed you are," he called out: "pray take my advice and come down here, where you will find plenty of better food."
The goat turned a knowing eye on him.
"It's little you care whether I get good grass or bad," said she: "what you want is to eat me."

A stag fell sick and lay in a clearing in the forest, too weak to move from the spot. When the news of his illness spread, a number of the other beasts came to inquire after his health, and they one and all nibbled a little of the grass that grew round the invalid till at last there was not a blade within his reach. In a few days he began to mend, but was still too feeble to get up and go in search of fodder, and thus he perished miserably of hunger owing to the thoughtlessness of his friends.

A certain man who had a donkey and a mule loaded them both up one day and set out on a journey. So long as the road was fairly level, the donkey got on very well: but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the donkey was at his last gasp. So he begged the mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the mule refused.
At last, from sheer weariness, the donkey stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed. The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the donkey's load to the mule's, and he also flayed the donkey and put his skin on the top of the double load.
The mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, "I have only got what I deserved: if I had been willing to help the donkey at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain."

A certain man had two children, a boy and a girl. The boy was as good-looking as the girl was plain. One day, as they were playing together in their mother's chamber, they chanced on a mirror and saw their own features for the first time. The boy saw what a handsome fellow he was, and began to boast to his sister about his good looks. She, on her part, was ready to cry with vexation when she was aware of her plainness, and took his remarks as an insult to herself. Running to her father, she told him of her brother's conceit, and accused him of meddling with his mother's things. He laughed and kissed them both, and said, "My children, learn from now onwards to make a good use of the glass. You, my boy, strive to be as good as it shows you to be handsome. And you, my girl, resolve to make up for the plainness of your features by the sweetness of your disposition."

A heifer went up to an ox, who was straining hard at the plough, and sympathised with him in a rather patronising sort of way on the necessity of his having to work so hard. Not long afterwards there was a festival in the village and everyone kept holiday: but, whereas the Ox was turned loose into the pasture, the heifer was seized and led off to sacrifice.
"Ah," said the ox, with a grim smile, "I see now why you were allowed to have such an idle time: it was because you were always intended for the altar."

When the lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a king ought to be. During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and drew up a code of laws that all were to live by in perfect equality and harmony: the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the stag, the leopard and the kid, the dog and the hare, all should dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship.
The hare said, "Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place without fear by the side of the strong!"

A donkey was being driven down a mountain road, and after jogging along for a while sensibly enough he suddenly quitted the track and rushed to the edge of a precipice. He was just about to leap over the edge when his driver caught hold of his tail and did his best to pull him back: but pull as he might he couldn't get the donkey to budge from the brink.
At last he gave up, crying, "All right, then, get to the bottom your own way; but it's the way to sudden death, as you'll find out quick enough."

A lion found a hare sleeping in her form and was just going to devour her when he caught sight of a passing stag. Dropping the hare, he at once made for the bigger game. However, after a long chase he found that he could not overtake the stag, so he abandoned the attempt and came back for the hare.
When he reached the spot, however, he found she was nowhere to be seen, and he had to go without his dinner.
"It serves me right," he said; "I should have been content with what I had got, instead of hankering after a better prize."

Once on a time the wolves said to the dogs, "Why should we continue to be enemies any longer? You are very like us in most ways: the main difference between us is one of training only. We live a life of freedom; but you are enslaved to mankind: People beat you, put heavy collars round your necks and compel you to keep watch over their flocks and herds for them. To crown all, they give you nothing but bones to eat. Don't put up with it any longer, but hand over the flocks to us, and we will all live on the fat of the land and feast together."
The dogs were persuaded by these words, and accompanied the wolves into their den. But no sooner were they well inside than the wolves set on them and tore them to pieces.

A full-grown bull was struggling to force his huge bulk through the narrow entrance to a cow-house where his stall was, when a young calf came up and said to him, "If you'll step aside a moment, I'll show you the way to get through."
The bull turned on him an amused look. "I knew that way," said he, "before you were born."

A woodman went into the forest and begged of the trees the favour of a handle for his axe. The principal trees at once agreed to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash sapling, out of which he fashioned the handle he desired.
No sooner had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest trees in the wood.
When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift, they cried, "Alas! alas! We are undone, but we are ourselves to blame. The little we gave has cost us all: had we not sacrificed the rights of the ash, we might ourselves have stood for ages."

There was once an astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well.
As he lay there groaning, someone passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, "If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you've got."

A labourer's little son was bitten by a snake and died of the wound. The father was beside himself with grief, and in his anger against the snake he caught up an axe and went and stood close to the snake's hole and watched for a chance of killing it
Before long the snake came out, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off the tip of its tail before it wriggled in again. He then tried to get it to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the quarrel. But the snake said, "I can never be your friend because of my lost tail, nor you mine because of your lost child."

A singing-bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window, and had a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep. One night a bat came and clung to the bars of the cage, and asked the bird why she was silent by day and sang only at night.
"I have a very good reason for doing so," said the bird: "it was once when I was singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and set his nets for me and caught me. Since then I have never sung except by night."
But the bat replied, "It is no use your doing that now when you are a prisoner: if only you had done so before you were caught, you might still have been free."

A man who wanted to buy a donkey went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like.
When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other donkeys. The newcomer took a look round, and at once went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?"
"I don't want to put him through any more tests," replied the other: "I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself."

A kid strayed from the flock and was chased by a wolf. When he saw he must be caught he turned round and said to the wolf, "I know, sir, that I can't escape being eaten by you: and so, as my life is bound to be short, I pray you let it be as merry as may be. Will you not play me a tune to dance to before I die?"
The wolf saw no objection to having some music before his dinner: so he took out his pipe and began to play, while the kid danced before him.
Before many minutes were passed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to see what was going on. They no sooner clapped eyes on the wolf than they gave chase and drove him away. As he ran off, he turned and said to the kid, "It's what I thoroughly deserve: my trade is the butcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you."

A man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his creditor; but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for delay. But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once. Then the debtor fetched a sow – the only one he had – and took her to market to offer her for sale. It happened that his creditor was there too.
Before long a buyer came along and asked if the sow produced good litters.
"Yes," said the debtor, "very fine ones; and the remarkable thing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the Panathenea."
At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in, "Don't be surprised, sir; why, still better, at the Dionysia this sow has kids!"

A man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day he went out hunting. It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he hadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it off, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt. But he quite entered into the joke, and said, "Ah, well! the hair that wig is made of didn't stick to the head on which it grew; so it's no wonder it won't stick to mine."

A herdsman was tending his cattle when he missed a young bull, one of the finest of the herd. He went at once to look for him, but, meeting with no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should discover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter.
Continuing his search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion devouring the lost bull. Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to heaven and cried, "Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf to thee if I should discover the thief: but now a full-grown bull I promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches."

One morning a mule, who had too much to eat and too little to do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked about saying, "My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and I take after him entirely."
But very soon afterwards he was put into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind him. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, "I must have been mistaken about my father; he can only have been a donkey after all."

A hound, roaming in the forest, spied a lion, and being well used to lesser game, gave chase, thinking he would make a fine quarry.
Before long the lion perceived that he was being pursued; so, stopping short, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar. The hound at once turned tail and fled. A fox, seeing him running away, jeered at him and said, "Ho! ho! There goes the coward who chased a lion and ran away the moment he roared!"

A man had two daughters, one of whom he gave in marriage to a gardener, and the other to a potter. After a time he thought he would go and see how they were getting on; and first he went to the gardener's wife. He asked her how she was, and how things were going with herself and her husband. She replied that on the whole they were doing very well: "But," she continued, "I do wish we could have some good heavy rain: the garden wants it badly."
Then he went on to the potter's wife and made the same inquiries of her. She replied that she and her husband had nothing to complain of: "But," she went on, "I do wish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery."
Her father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face. "You want dry weather," he said, "and your sister wants rain. I was going to ask in my prayers that your wishes should be granted; but now it strikes me I had better not refer to the subject."

A thief hired a room at an inn, and stayed there some days on the look-out for something to steal. No opportunity, however, presented itself, till one day, when there was a festival to be celebrated, the innkeeper appeared in a fine new coat and sat down before the door of the inn for an airing. The thief no sooner set eyes on the coat than he longed to take of it. There was no business doing, so he went and took a seat by the side of the innkeeper, and began talking to him.
They conversed together for some time, and then the thief suddenly yawned and howled like a wolf. The innkeeper asked him in some concern what ailed him.
The thief replied, "I will tell you about myself, sir, but first I must beg you to take charge of my clothes for me, for I intend to leave them with you. Why I have these fits of yawning I cannot tell: maybe they are sent as a punishment for my misdeeds; but, whatever the reason, the facts are that when I have yawned three times I become a ravening wolf and fly at men's throats."
As he finished speaking he yawned a second time and howled again as before. The innkeeper, believing every word he said, and terrified at the prospect of being confronted with a wolf, got up hastily and started to run indoors; but the thief caught him by the coat and tried to stop him, crying, "Stay, sir, stay, and take charge of my clothes, or else I shall never see them again."
As he spoke he opened his mouth and began to yawn for the third time. The innkeeper, mad with the fear of being eaten by a wolf, slipped out of his coat, which remained in the other's hands, and bolted into the inn and locked the door behind him; and the thief then quietly stole off with his spoil.

A wild donkey, who was wandering idly about, one day came on a pack-donkey lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself. Going up to him, he said, "What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat shows how well you live: how I envy you!"
Not long after the wild donkey saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick.
"Ah, my friend," said the wild donkey, "I don't envy you any more: for I see you pay dear for your comforts."

A gardener had a donkey that had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating. The donkey therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the gardener and hand him over to another master. So Jupiter sent Mercury to the gardener to bid him sell the donkey to a potter, which he did.
But the donkey was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before: so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a tanner.
But when the donkey saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, "Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated? for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat."

A wild donkey saw a pack-donkey jogging along under a heavy load, and taunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these words: "What a vile lot is yours compared with mine! I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work; and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs. But you! you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully."
At that moment a lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the pack-donkey owing to the presence of the driver; but he fell on the wild donkey, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.

Ants were once men and made their living by tilling the soil. But, not content with the results of their own work, they were always casting longing eyes on the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they stole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store. At last their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into ants.
But, though their forms were changed, their nature remained the same: and so, to this day, they go about among the cornfields and gather the fruits of others' labour, and store them up for their own use.

Two frogs lived together in a marsh. But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, "This looks a nice cool place: let us jump in and settle here."
But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, "Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?"

A crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some way inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a good place to feed in. But a hungry fox came along and spied the crab and caught him.
Just as he was going to be eaten up, the crab said, "This is just what I deserve; for I had no business to leave my natural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the land."

A grasshopper sat chirping in the branches of a tree. A fox heard her, and, thinking what a dainty morsel she would make, he tried to get her down by a trick. Standing below in full view of her, he praised her song in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying he would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a voice.
But she was not to be taken in, and replied, "You are very much mistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down: I keep well out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw numbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's earth."

A farmer had just sown a field of wheat, and was keeping a careful watch over it, for numbers of rooks and starlings kept continually settling on it and eating up the grain. Along with him went his boy, carrying a sling: and whenever the farmer asked for the sling the starlings understood what he said and warned the rooks and they were off in a moment. So the farmer hit on a trick.
"My lad," said he, "we must get the better of these birds somehow. After this, when I want the sling, I won't say 'sling,' but just 'humph!' and you must then hand me the sling quickly."
Before long back came the whole flock. "Humph!" said the farmer. The starlings took no notice, and he had time to sling several stones among them, hitting one on the head, another in the legs, and another in the wing, before they got out of range.
As they made all haste away they met some cranes, who asked them what the matter was.
"Matter?" said one of the rooks; "it's those rascals, men, that are the matter. Don't you go near them. They have a way of saying one thing and meaning another which has just been the death of several of our poor friends."

A donkey and a dog were on their travels together, and, as they went along, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground. The donkey picked it up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he proceeded to read out aloud to the dog. As he read on it turned out to be all about grass and barley and hay – in short, all the kinds of fodder that donkeys are fond of.
The dog was a good deal bored with listening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of him, and he cried, "Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there isn't something about meat and bones."
The donkey glanced all through the packet, but found nothing of the sort, and said so. Then the dog said in disgust, "Oh, throw it away, do: what's the good of a thing like that?"

A certain man put an image on the back of his donkey to take it to one of the temples of the town. As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the image; but the donkey thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly. At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further.
His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, "Oh, you dunderheaded idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to a donkey?"

An Athenian and a Theban were on the road together, and passed the time in conversation, as is the way of travellers. After discussing a variety of subjects they began to talk about heroes, a topic that tends to be more fertile than edifying. Each of them was lavish in his praises of the heroes of his own city.	Eventually the Theban asserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on earth and now occupied a foremost place among the gods; while the Athenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, for his fortune had been in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time been forced to act as a servant.
He gained his point, for he was a very glib fellow, like all Athenians; so that the Theban, who was no match for him in talking, cried at last in some disgust, "All right, have your way; I only hope that, when our heroes are angry with us, Athens may suffer from the anger of Hercules, and Thebes only from that of Theseus."

A goatherd was one day gathering his flock to return to the fold, when one of his goats strayed and refused to join the rest. He tried for a long time to get her to return by calling and whistling to her, but the goat took no notice of him at all; so at last he threw a stone at her and broke one of her horns.
In dismay, he begged her not to tell his master: but she replied, "You silly fellow, my horn would cry aloud even if I held my tongue."

Once on a time the sheep complained to the shepherd about the difference in his treatment of themselves and his dog.
"Your conduct," said they, "is very strange and, we think, very unfair. We provide you with wool and lambs and milk and you give us nothing but grass, and even that we have to find for ourselves: but you get nothing at all from the dog, and yet you feed him with tit-bits from your own table."
Their remarks were overheard by the dog, who spoke up at once and said, "Yes, and quite right, too: where would you be if it wasn't for me? Thieves would steal you! wolves would eat you! Indeed, if I didn't keep constant watch over you, you would be too terrified even to graze!"
The sheep had to acknowledge that he spoke the truth, and never again made a grievance of the regard in which he was held by his master.

A shepherd found a wolf's cub straying in the pastures, and took him home and reared him along with his dogs. When the cub grew to his full size, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the dogs in hunting him down. It sometimes happened that the dogs failed to come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home. The wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and when he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him, and then return to the shepherd. But if some time passed without a sheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself and share his plunder with the dogs.
The shepherd's suspicions were aroused, and one day he caught him in the act. Fastening a rope round the wolf's neck, he hung him on the nearest tree.

The lion, for all his size and strength and his sharp teeth and claws, can't bear the sound of a cock crowing, and runs away whenever he hears it. He complained bitterly to Jupiter for making him like that; but Jupiter said he had done the best he could for him, and he ought to be well content.
The lion, however, wouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he wished he might die. In this state of mind, he met the elephant and had a talk with him. He noticed that the great beast cocked up his ears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked him why he did so. Just then a gnat came humming by, and the elephant said, "Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect? I'm terribly afraid of its getting into my ear: if it once gets in, I'm dead and done for."
The lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: "For," he said to himself, "if the elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a gnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is ten thousand times bigger than a gnat."

A pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of sheep were grazing. The shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the butcher's when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free.
The sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, "The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we don't make any fuss."
"No, I dare say not," replied the pig, "but my case and yours are altogether different: he only wants you for wool, but he wants me for bacon."

A gardener's dog fell into a deep well that his master used to draw water from for the plants in his garden, using a rope and a bucket. Failing to get the dog out by means of these, the gardener went down into the well himself in order to fetch him up. But the dog thought he had come to make sure of drowning him; so he bit his master as soon as he came within reach and hurt him a good deal.
The result was that the gardener left the dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking, "It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide."

Once on a time all the rivers combined to protest against the action of the sea in making their waters salt.
"When we come to you," said they to the sea, "we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own."
The sea replied shortly, "Keep away from me, then, and you'll remain sweet."

A lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted to marry her. Her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome a husband, and yet didn't want to offend the lion, so he went to the lion and said, "I think you will make a very good husband for my daughter: but I cannot consent to your union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my daughter is terribly afraid of them."
The lion was so much in love that he readily agreed that this should be done. When once, however, he was thus disarmed, the cottager was afraid of him no longer, but drove him away with his club.

A thief found his way into an apiary when the bee-keeper was away, and stole all the honey. When the keeper returned and found the hives empty, he was very much upset and stood staring at them for some time.
Before long the bees came back from gathering honey, and, finding their hives overturned and the keeper standing by, they made for him with their stings. At this he fell into a passion and cried, "You ungrateful scoundrels, you let the thief who stole my honey get off scot-free, and then you go and sting me who have always taken such care of you!"

A wolf on his rambles came to a field of oats, but, not being able to eat them, he was passing on his way when a horse came along.
"Look," said the wolf, "here's a fine field of oats. For your sake I have left it untouched, and I shall greatly enjoy the sound of your teeth munching the ripe grain."
But the horse replied, "If wolves could eat oats, my fine friend, you would hardly have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."

A bat, a bramble, and a seagull went into partnership and determined to go on a trading voyage together. The bat borrowed a sum of money for his venture; the bramble laid in a stock of clothes of various kinds; and the seagull took a quantity of lead: and so they set out. By and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo went to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land.
Ever since then the seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every now and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost; while the bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away by day and only comes out at night to feed; and the bramble catches hold of the clothes of everyone who passes by, hoping some day to recognise and recover the lost garments.

A dog was lying in the sun before a farmyard gate when a wolf pounced on him and was just going to eat him up; but he begged for his life and said, "You see how thin I am and what a wretched meal I should make you now: but if you will only wait a few days my master is going to give a feast. All the rich scraps and pickings will fall to me and I shall get nice and fat: then will be the time for you to eat me."
The wolf thought this was a very good plan and went away. Some time afterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the dog lying out of reach on the stable roof.
"Come down," he called, "and be eaten: you remember our agreement?"
But the dog said coolly, "My friend, if ever you catch me lying down by the gate there again, don't you wait for any feast."

A wasp settled on the head of a snake, and not only stung him several times, but clung obstinately to the head of his victim. Maddened with pain the snake tried every means he could think of to get rid of the creature, but without success.
At last he became desperate, and crying, "Kill you I will, even at the cost of my own life," he laid his head with the wasp on it under the wheel of a passing wagon, and they both perished together.

An eagle was chasing a hare, which was running for dear life and was at her wits' end to know where to turn for help. Before long she espied a beetle, and begged it to aid her. So when the eagle came up the beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its protection. But the eagle never noticed the beetle because it was so small, seized the hare and ate her up.
The beetle never forgot this, and used to keep an eye on the eagle's nest, and whenever the eagle laid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it.
At last the eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she went up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of eagles, and begged him to give her a safe place to nest in: so he let her lay her eggs in his lap. But the beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size of an eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap.
When Jupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and, forgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken just as before.
Ever since then, they say, eagles never lay their eggs at the season when beetles are about.

A fowler was setting his nets for little birds when a lark came up to him and asked him what he was doing.
"I am engaged in founding a city," said he, and with that he withdrew to a short distance and hid himself.
The lark examined the nets with great curiosity, and presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order to secure it, and became entangled in the meshes. The fowler then ran up quickly and captured her.
"What a fool I was!" said she: "but at any rate, if that's the kind of city you are founding, it'll be a long time before you find fools enough to fill it."

A fisherman who could play the flute went down one day to the sea-shore with his nets and his flute; and, taking his stand on a projecting rock, began to play a tune, thinking that the music would bring the fish jumping out of the sea. He went on playing for some time, but not a fish appeared: so at last he threw down his flute and cast his net into the sea, and made a great haul of fish.
When they were landed and he saw them leaping about on the shore, he cried, "You rascals! you wouldn't dance when I piped: but now I've stopped, you can do nothing else!"

A man once caught a weasel, which was always sneaking about the house, and was just going to drown it in a tub of water, when it begged hard for its life, and said to him, "Surely you haven't the heart to put me to death? Think how useful I have been in clearing your house of the mice and lizards which used to infest it, and show your gratitude by sparing my life."
"You have not been altogether useless, I grant you," said the man: "but who killed the fowls? Who stole the meat? No, no! You do much more harm than good, and die you shall."

A ploughman yoked his ox and his donkey together, and set to work to plough his field. It was a poor makeshift of a team, but it was the best he could do, as he had but a single ox.
At the end of the day, when the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the donkey said to the ox, "Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?"
The ox looked surprised at the question.
"Why," said he, "you, to be sure, as usual."

Demades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens; but the people were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped and said, "Gentlemen, I should like to tell you one of Æsop's fables."
This made everyone listen intently. Then Demades began: "Demeter, a swallow, and an eel were once travelling together, and came to a river without a bridge: the swallow flew over it, and the eel swam across"; and then he stopped.
"What happened to Demeter?" cried several people in the audience.
"Demeter," he replied, "is very angry with you for listening to fables when you ought to be minding public business."

When people go on a voyage they often take with them lapdogs or monkeys as pets to while away the time. Thus it fell out that a man returning to Athens from the East had a pet monkey on board with him. As they neared the coast of Attica a great storm burst on them, and the ship capsized. All on board were thrown into the water, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the monkey among the rest. A dolphin saw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and began swimming towards the shore. When they got near the Piræus, which is the port of Athens, the dolphin asked the monkey if he was an Athenian. The monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished family.
"Then, of course, you know the Piræus," continued the dolphin. The monkey thought he was referring to some high official or other, and replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very old friend of mine."
At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the dolphin was so disgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate monkey was quickly drowned.

A hungry crow spied a snake lying asleep in a sunny spot, and, picking it up in his claws, he was carrying it off to a place where he could make a meal of it without being disturbed, when the snake reared its head and bit him.
It was a poisonous snake, and the bite was fatal, and the dying crow said, "What a cruel fate is mine! I thought I had made a lucky find, and it has cost me my life!"

Some dogs once found a lion's skin, and were worrying it with their teeth. Just then a fox came by, and said, "You think yourselves very brave, no doubt; but if that were a live lion you'd find his claws a good deal sharper than your teeth."

A nightingale was sitting on a bough of an oak and singing, as her custom was. A hungry hawk presently spied her, and darting to the spot seized her in his talons. He was just about to tear her in pieces when she begged him to spare her life: "I'm not big enough," she pleaded, "to make you a good meal: you ought to seek your prey among the bigger birds."
The hawk eyed her with some contempt. "You must think me very simple," said he, "if you suppose I am going to give up a certain prize on the chance of a better of which I see at present no signs."

A rose and an amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden, and the amaranth said to her neighbour, "How I envy you your beauty and your sweet scent! No wonder you are such a universal favourite."
But the rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, "Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time: my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die. But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for they are everlasting."

One winter's day, during a severe storm, a horse, an ox, and a dog came and begged for shelter in the house of a man. He readily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort: and he put oats before the horse, and hay before the ox, while he fed the dog with the remains of his own dinner.
When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the following way: They divided the life of man among them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his own. The horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint; the ox took middle age, and accordingly men in middle life are steady and hard-working; while the dog took old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.

The wolves sent a deputation to the sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death. The foolish sheep agreed to the terms; but an old ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"

The swan is said to sing but once in its life – when it knows that it is about to die. A certain man, who had heard of the song of the swan, one day saw one of these birds for sale in the market, and bought it and took it home with him. A few days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the swan, and bade it sing for their entertainment: but the swan remained silent.
In course of time, when it was growing old, it became aware of its approaching end and broke into a sweet, sad song. When its owner heard it, he said angrily, "If the creature only sings when it is about to die, what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song! I ought to have wrung its neck instead of merely inviting it to sing."

A snake suffered a good deal from being constantly trodden on by man and beast, owing partly to the length of his body and partly to his being unable to raise himself above the surface of the ground: so he went and complained to Jupiter about the risks to which he was exposed.
But Jupiter had little sympathy for him. "I dare say," said he, "that if you had bitten the first that trod on you, the others would have taken more trouble to look where they put their feet."

A wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was getting low in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his shadow, and said to himself, "I had no idea I was so big. Fancy my being afraid of a lion! Why, I, not he, ought to be king of the beasts"; and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there could be no doubt at all about it. Just then a lion sprang on him and began to devour him.
"Alas," he cried, "had I not lost sight of the facts, I shouldn't have been ruined by my fancies."

A ploughman loosed his oxen from the plough, and led them away to the water to drink. While he was absent a half-starved wolf appeared on the scene, and went up to the plough and began chewing the leather straps attached to the yoke. As he gnawed away desperately in the hope of satisfying his craving for food, he somehow got entangled in the harness, and, taking fright, struggled to get free, tugging at the traces as if he would drag the plough along with him.
Just then the ploughman came back, and seeing what was happening, he cried, "Ah, you old rascal, I wish you would give up thieving for good and take to honest work instead."

A man once saw a ship go down with all its crew, and commented severely on the injustice of the gods.
"They care nothing for a man's character," said he, "but let the good and the bad go to their deaths together."
There was an ant-heap close by where he was standing, and, just as he spoke, he was bitten in the foot by an ant. Turning in a temper to the ant-heap he stamped on it and crushed hundreds of unoffending ants.
Suddenly Mercury appeared, and hit him with his staff, saying as he did so, "You villain, where's your nice sense of justice now?"

A lion watched a fat bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns. Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.
Going up to the bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, "I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure. What a fine head! What powerful shoulders and thighs! But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns? You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly. Believe me, you would do much better without them."
The bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defence, fell an easy prey to the lion.

A man once bought a parrot and gave it the run of his house. It revelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece and screamed away to its heart's content. The noise disturbed the cat, who was asleep on the hearthrug. Looking up at the intruder, she said, "Who may you be, and where have you come from?"
The parrot replied, "Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him."
"You impudent bird," said the cat, "how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise like that? Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and yet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all over the place."
"Look here, mistress," said the parrot, "you just hold your tongue. They delight in my voice, but yours – yours is a perfect nuisance."

A stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he hoped to be safe from his pursuers. Unfortunately there was a lion in the cave.
The stag fell an easy prey to it. "Unhappy that I am," he cried, "I am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of a lion."

A certain man fell ill, and, being in a very bad way, he made a vow that he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant him a return to health. Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they caused him to recover in a short time. Now, he hadn't an ox in the world, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar, at the same time saying, "Ye gods, I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow."
The gods determined to get even with him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there.
Hastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of robbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and when they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.

Once on a time a number of dogs that were famished with hunger saw some hides steeping in a river, but couldn't get at them because the water was too deep. So they put their heads together, and decided to drink away at the river till it was shallow enough for them to reach the hides. But long before that happened they burst themselves with drinking.

A lion, a fox, and a donkey went out hunting together. They had soon taken a large booty, which the lion requested the donkey to divide between them. The donkey divided it all into three equal parts, and modestly begged the others to take their choice; at which the lion, bursting with fury, sprang on the donkey and tore him to pieces. Then, glaring at the fox, he bade him make a fresh division. The fox gathered almost the whole in one great heap for the lion's share, leaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself.
"My dear friend," said the lion, "how did you get the knack of it so well?"
The fox replied, "Me? Oh, I took a lesson from the donkey."

One day, as a fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and bread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly. The larder was empty, so he went out and caught a tame partridge that he kept as a decoy, and was about to wring her neck when she cried, "Surely you won't kill me? Why, what will you do without me next time you go fowling? How will you get the birds to come to your nets?"
He let her go at this, and went to his hen-house, where he had a plump young cock.
When the cock saw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, "If you kill me, how will you know the time of night? and who will wake you up in the morning when it is time to get to work?"
The fowler, however, replied, "You are useful for telling the time, I know; but, for all that, I can't send my friend supperless to bed."
And with that he caught him and wrung his neck.

A gnat once went up to a lion and said, "I am not in the least afraid of you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in strength. What does your strength amount to after all? That you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth – just like a woman in a temper – and nothing more. But I'm stronger than you: if you don't believe it, let us fight and see."
So saying, the gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the lion on the nose. When the lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its victory.
Before long, however, it got entangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed over the king of the beasts.

A farmer was snowed up in his farmstead by a severe storm, and was unable to go out and procure provisions for himself and his family. So he first killed his sheep and used them for food; then, as the storm still continued, he killed his goats; and, last of all, as the weather showed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and eat them.
When his dogs saw the various animals being killed and eaten in turn, they said to one another, "We had better get out of this or we shall be the next to go!"

An eagle and a fox became great friends and determined to live near one another: they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be. So the eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs.
One day the fox went out foraging for food, and the eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family.
When the fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the eagle and pay her out for her treachery. So she sat down not far off and cursed her. But it wasn't long before she had her revenge. Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest. There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground. Then the fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the eagle.

Two men were buying meat at a butcher's stall in the market-place, and, while the butcher's back was turned for a moment, one of them snatched up a joint and hastily thrust it under the other's cloak, where it could not be seen. When the butcher turned round, he missed the meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it: but the one who had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it said he hadn't taken it.
The butcher felt sure they were deceiving him, but he only said, "You may cheat me with your lying, but you can't cheat the gods, and they won't let you off so lightly."

Hercules was once travelling along a narrow road when he saw lying on the ground in front of him what appeared to be an apple, and as he passed he stamped on it with his heel. To his astonishment, instead of being crushed it doubled in size; and, on his attacking it again and smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and blocked up the whole road. Upon this he dropped his club, and stood looking at it in amazement.
Just then Minerva appeared, and said to him, "Leave it alone, my friend; that which you see before you is the apple of discord: if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it was at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing you see."

A lion had a fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the fox found the prey and the lion fell on it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions. But the lion always got a very large share, and the fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all. He determined to set up on his own account. He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him. The hunter was now the hunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.

A certain man fell sick and took to his bed. He consulted a number of doctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him that his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would probably last a considerable time. The one who took a different view of his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare for the worst: "You don't have twenty-four hours to live," said he, "and I fear I can do nothing."
As it turned out, however, he was quite wrong; for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and took a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost. In the course of his walk he met the doctor who had prophesied his death.
"Dear me," said the latter, "how do you do? You are fresh from the other world, no doubt. Pray, how are our departed friends getting on there?"
"Most comfortably," replied the other, "for they have drunk the water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life. By the way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements to prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in the course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive. They were going to charge you along with the rest, till I assured them that you were no doctor, but a mere impostor."

A lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the fox. The wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the fox, so he called the attention of the lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."
Just then the fox came in and heard the last words of the wolf. The lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."
"And may I ask if you have found one?" said the lion.
"I have, sire," said the fox, "and it is this: you must flay a wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."
The lion accordingly turned to the wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the fox's prescription; but the fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comes of stirring up ill-will."

When Hercules was received among the gods and was entertained at a banquet by Jupiter, he responded courteously to the greetings of all with the exception of Plutus, the god of wealth. When Plutus approached him, Hercules cast his eyes on the ground, and turned away and pretended not to see him. Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his part, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other gods, he had behaved like that to Plutus.
"Sire," said Hercules, "I do not like Plutus, and I will tell you why. When we were on earth together I always noticed that he was to be found in the company of scoundrels."

A fox and a leopard were disputing about their looks, and each claimed to be the more handsome of the two. The leopard said, "Look at my smart coat; you have nothing to match that."
But the fox replied, "Your coat may be smart, but my wits are smarter still."

A fox, in swimming across a rapid river, was swept away by the current and carried a long way downstream in spite of his struggles, until at last, bruised and exhausted, he managed to scramble on to dry ground from a backwater. As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of horseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was too weak even to shake them off.
A hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him; but the fox replied, "Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now; but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins."

A crow became very jealous of a raven because the raven was regarded by men as a bird of omen, one that foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen, until one of them, spying the crow, said to his companions, "It's all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that means nothing."

A witch professed to be able to avert the anger of the gods by means of secret charms that she alone knew. She drove a brisk trade by this, and made a fat livelihood out of it. But certain persons accused her of black magic and carried her before the judges, and demanded that she should be put to death for dealings with the devil.
She was found guilty and condemned to death. One of the judges said to her as she was leaving the dock, "You say you can avert the anger of the gods. How comes it, then, that you have failed to disarm the enmity of men?"

An old man cut himself a bundle of faggots in a wood and started to carry them home. He had a long way to go, and was tired out before he had got much more than halfway. Casting his burden on the ground, he called on Death to come and release him from his life of toil. The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him.
The man was almost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out, "Good sir, if you'd be so kind, please help me up with my burden again."

A miser sold everything he had, and melted down his hoard of gold into a single lump, which he buried secretly in a field. Every day he went to look at it, and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his treasure.
One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot, and one day watched him and discovered his secret. Waiting his opportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it.
Next day the miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure gone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss. In this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what his trouble was. The miser told him of his misfortune; but the other replied, "Don't take it so much to heart, my friend; put a brick into the hole, and take a look at it every day: you won't be any worse off than before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you."

A number of foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to drink; but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and dangerous that they didn't dare to do so, but stood near the edge encouraging one another not to be afraid. At last one of them, to shame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, "I am not a bit frightened! See, I'll step right into the water!"
He had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet.
When the others saw him being carried down-stream they cried, "Don't go and leave us! Come back and show us where we too can drink with safety."
But he replied, "I'm afraid I can't yet: I want to go to the seaside, and this current will take me there nicely. When I come back I'll show you with pleasure."

There was once a horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all to himself. But one day a stag came into the meadow, and said he had as good a right to feed there as the horse, and moreover chose all the best places for himself. The horse, wishing to be revenged on his unwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the stag.
"Yes," said the man, "I will by all means; but I can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back."
The horse agreed to this, and the two together very soon turned the stag out of the pasture: but when that was done, the horse found to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good.

In making his way through a hedge a fox missed his footing and caught at a bramble to save himself from falling. Naturally, he got badly scratched, and in disgust he cried to the bramble, "It was your help I wanted, and see how you have treated me! I'd sooner have fallen outright."
The bramble, interrupting him, replied, "You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at others."

A snake, in crossing a river, was carried away by the current, but managed to wriggle on to a bundle of thorns which was floating by, and was thus carried at a great rate down-stream.
A fox caught sight of it from the bank as it went whirling along, and called out, "Gad! the passenger fits the ship!"

A lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food. So he said to his friend the fox, who came to ask how he did, "My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big stag, who lives there, to come to my den: I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains."
The fox went to the wood and found the stag and said to him, "My dear sir, you're in luck. You know the lion, our king: well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts. I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news. And now I must be going back to him; and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last."
The stag was highly flattered, and followed the fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing. No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang on him, but he misjudged his spring, and the stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood.
The fox was much mortified, and the lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness. So he begged the fox to have another try at coaxing the stag to his den.
"It'll be almost impossible this time," said the fox, "but I'll try." Off he went to the wood a second time, and found the stag resting and trying to recover from his fright. As soon as he saw the fox he cried, "You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that? Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns."
But the fox was entirely shameless. "What a coward you were," said he; "surely you didn't think the lion meant any harm? Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit. You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf king instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit. I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant."
The stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the lion made no mistake, but overpowered him and feasted right royally on his carcase.
The fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble.
Before long the lion began searching for them, of course without success: and the fox, who was watching him, said, "I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains: a creature who twice walked into a lion's den can't have got any."

A man was engaged in digging over his vineyard, and one day on coming to work he missed his spade. Thinking it may have been stolen by one of his labourers, he questioned them closely, but they one and all denied any knowledge of it. He was not convinced by their denials, and insisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple that they were not guilty of the theft. This was because he had no great opinion of the simple country deities, but thought that the thief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town.
When they got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town crier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had stolen something from the city temple.
"Well," said the man to himself, "it strikes me I had better go back home again. If these town gods can't detect the thieves who steal from their own temples, it's scarcely likely they can tell me who stole my Spade."

A fowler caught a partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said, "Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets."
"No," said the fowler, "I will not spare you. I was going to kill you anyhow, and after that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate."

A slave, discontented with his lot, ran away from his master. He was soon missed by the latter, who lost no time in mounting his horse and setting out in pursuit of the fugitive. In a short time he came up with him, and the slave, in the hope of avoiding capture, slipped into a treadmill and hid himself there.
"Aha," said his master, "that's the very place for you, my man!"

A hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and, catching sight presently of a woodman engaged in felling a tree, he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints anywhere about, or if he knew where his den was.
The woodman answered, "If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself."
The hunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied, "Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks."

An eagle swooped down on a serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there followed a life-and-death struggle between the two.
A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge the serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents on the ground.

A rogue laid a wager that he would prove the oracle at Delphi to be untrustworthy by getting from it a false reply to an inquiry by himself. So he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small bird in his hand, which he hid under the folds of his cloak, and asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead. If the oracle said "dead," he meant to produce the bird alive: if the reply was "alive," he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead. But the oracle was one too many for him, for the answer he got was this:
"Stranger, whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive or dead, is a matter that depends entirely on your own will."

A horse, proud of his fine harness, met a donkey on the high-road. As the donkey with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster. The donkey held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence.
Not long afterwards the horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer. One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the donkey again, who in turn derided him and said, "Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud! Where are all your gay trappings now?"

A dog was chasing a wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the ground. "Now, there's this wolf," he said to himself, "what a poor creature he is: he's no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs away."
But the wolf looked round just then and said, "Don't you imagine I'm running away from you, my friend: it's your master I'm afraid of."

When Jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges, it so happened that Grief was not present with the rest: but when all had received their share, he too entered and claimed his due. Jupiter was at a loss to know what to do, for there was nothing left for Grief. However, at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that are shed for the dead.
Thus it is the same with Grief as it is with the other gods. The more devoutly men render to him his due, the more lavish is he of that which he has to bestow. It is not well, therefore, to mourn long for the departed; else Grief, whose sole pleasure is in such mourning, will be quick to send fresh cause for tears.

The pigeons in a certain dovecote were persecuted by a kite, who every now and then swooped down and carried off one of their number. So they invited a hawk into the dovecote to defend them against their enemy.
But they soon repented of their folly: for the hawk killed more of them in a day than the kite had done in a year.

A woman, who had lately lost her husband, used to go every day to his grave and lament her loss. A farmer, who was engaged in ploughing not far from the spot, set eyes on the woman and desired to have her for his wife, so he left his plough and came and sat by her side, and began to shed tears himself. She asked him why he wept, and he replied, "I have lately lost my wife, who was very dear to me, and tears ease my grief."
"And I," said she, "have lost my husband."
And so for a while they mourned in silence. Then he said, "Since you and I are in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together? I shall take the place of your dead husband, and you, that of my dead wife."
The woman agreed to the plan, which seemed reasonable enough: and they dried their tears. Meanwhile, a thief had come and stolen the oxen that the farmer had left with his plough. On discovering the theft, he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his loss. When the woman heard his cries, she came and said, "Why, are you weeping still?"
To which he replied, "Yes, and I mean it this time."

At the bidding of Jupiter, Prometheus set about the creation of man and the other animals. Jupiter, seeing that mankind, the only rational creatures, were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts, bade him redress the balance by turning some of the latter into men. Prometheus did as he was bidden, and this is why some people have the forms of men but the souls of beasts.

A swallow was once boasting to a crow about her birth. "I was once a princess," said she, "the daughter of a king of Athens, but my husband used me cruelly, and cut out my tongue for a slight fault. Then, to protect me from further injury, I was turned by Juno into a bird."
"You chatter quite enough as it is," said the crow. "What you would have been like if you hadn't lost your tongue, I can't think."

A hunter went out after game, and succeeded in catching a hare, which he was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback, who said to him, "You have had some sport I see, sir," and offered to buy it.
The hunter readily agreed; but the horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop. The hunter ran after him for some little distance; but it soon dawned on him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to overtake the horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud as he could, "All right, sir, all right, take your hare: it was meant all along as a present."

A goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number of wild goats approach and mingle with his flock. At the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together. Next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual: so he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there. He only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the wild goats as much as they could eat and more; for he was very anxious for them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn't want to leave him.
When the weather improved, he took them all out to pasture again; but no sooner had they got near the hills than the wild goats broke away from the flock and scampered off.
The goatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for their ingratitude.
"Rascals!" he cried, "to run away like that after the way I've treated you!"
Hearing this, one of them turned round and said, "Oh, yes, you treated us all right – too well, in fact; it was just that that put us on our guard. If you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely that, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, we should then be neglected in favour of the last comers."

A swallow, conversing with a nightingale, advised her to quit the leafy coverts where she made her home, and to come and live with men, like herself, and nest under the shelter of their roofs.
But the nightingale replied, "Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among men: but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them hateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings."

A traveller, exhausted with fatigue after a long journey, sank down at the very brink of a deep well and presently fell asleep. He was within an ace of falling in, when Fortune herself appeared to him and touched him on the shoulder, cautioning him to move further away from the brink.
"Oh, wake up, sir!" she said. "If you had fallen into the well, the blame could have been thrown not on your own folly, but on me, Fortune."

An Ant came down to the brook: he wanted to drink. A wave washed him down and almost drowned him. A Dove was carrying a branch; she saw the Ant was drowning, so she cast the branch down to him in the brook. The Ant got up on the branch and was saved. Then a hunter placed a snare for the Dove, and was on the point of drawing it in. The Ant crawled up to the hunter and bit him on the leg; the hunter groaned and dropped the snare. The Dove fluttered upwards and flew away.

A Turtle asked an Eagle to teach her how to fly. The Eagle advised her not to try, as she was not fit for it; but she insisted. The Eagle took her in his claws, raised her up, and dropped her: she fell on stones and broke to pieces.

A Polecat entered a smithy and began to lick the filings. Blood began to flow from the Polecat's mouth, but he was glad and continued to lick; he thought that the blood was coming from the iron, and lost his whole tongue.

A Lion was sleeping. A Mouse ran over his body. He awoke and caught her. The Mouse besought him; she said:
"Let me go, and I will do you a favour!"
The Lion laughed at the Mouse for promising him a favour, and let her go.
Then the hunters caught the Lion and tied him with a rope to a tree. The Mouse heard the Lion's roar, ran up, gnawed the rope through, and said:
"Do you remember? You laughed, not thinking that I could repay, but now you see that a favour may come also from a Mouse."

A Boy was watching the sheep and, pretending that he saw a wolf, he began to cry:
Help! A wolf! A wolf!"
 peasants came running up and saw that it was not so. After doing this for a second and a third time, it happened that a wolf came indeed. The Boy began to cry:
Come, come, quickly, a wolf!"
 peasants thought that he was deceiving them as usual, and paid no attention to him. The wolf saw there was no reason to be afraid: he leisurely killed the whole flock.

A man had an Ass and a Horse. They were walking on the road; the Ass said to the Horse:
It is heavy for me.—I shall not be able to carry it all; take at least a part of my load."
Horse paid no attention to him. The Ass fell down from overstraining himself, and died. When the master transferred the Ass's load on the Horse, and added the Ass's hide, the Horse began to complain:
Oh, woe to me, poor one, woe to me, unfortunate Horse! I did not want to help him even a little, and now I have to carry everything, and his hide, too."

A Jackdaw saw that the Doves were well fed,—so she painted herself white and flew into the dove-cot. The Doves thought at first that she was a dove like them, and let her in. But the Jackdaw forgot herself and croaked in jackdaw fashion. Then the Doves began to pick at her and drove her away. The Jackdaw flew back to her friends, but the jackdaws were frightened at her, seeing her white, and themselves drove her away.

A Hen laid an egg each day. The Mistress thought that if she gave her more to eat, she would lay twice as much. So she did. The Hen grew fat and stopped laying.

A Lion and a Bear procured some meat and began to fight for it. The Bear did not want to give in, nor did the Lion yield. They fought for so long a time that they both grew feeble and lay down. A Fox saw the meat between them; she grabbed it and ran away with it.

A Dog and a Cock went to travel together. At night the Cock fell asleep in a tree, and the Dog fixed a place for himself between the roots of that tree. When the time came, the Cock began to crow. A Fox heard the Cock, ran up to the tree, and began to beg the Cock to come down, as she wanted to give him her respects for such a fine voice.
The Cock said:
"You must first wake up the janitor,—he is sleeping between the roots. Let him open up, and I will come down."
The Fox began to look for the janitor, and started yelping. The Dog sprang out at once and killed the Fox.

A Groom stole the Horse's oats, and sold them, but he cleaned the Horse each day. Said the Horse:
"If you really wish me to be in good condition, do not sell my oats."

A Lion heard a Frog croaking, and thought it was a large beast that was calling so loud. He walked up, and saw a Frog coming out of the swamp. The Lion crushed her with his paw and said:
"There is nothing to look at, and yet I was frightened."

In the fall the wheat of the Ants got wet; they were drying it. A hungry Grasshopper asked them for something to eat. The Ants said:
"Why did you not gather food during the summer?"
She said:
"I had no time: I sang songs."
They laughed, and said:
"If you sang in the summer, dance in the winter!"

A master had a Hen which laid golden eggs. He wanted more gold at once, and so killed the Hen (he thought that inside of her there was a large lump of gold), but she was just like any other hen.

An Ass put on a lion's skin, and all thought it was a lion. Men and animals ran away from him. A wind sprang up, and the skin was blown aside, and the Ass could be seen. People ran up and beat the Ass.

A Hen found some snake's eggs and began to sit on them. A Swallow saw it and said:
"Stupid one! You will hatch them out, and, when they grow up, you will be the first one to suffer from them."

A Fawn once said to a Stag:
"Father, you are larger and fleeter than the dogs, and, besides, you have huge antlers for defence; why, then, are you so afraid of the dogs?"
The Stag laughed, and said:
"You speak the truth, my child. The trouble is,—the moment I hear the dogs bark, I run before I have time to think."

A Fox saw some ripe bunches of grapes hanging high, and tried to get at them, in order to eat them.
The tried hard, but could not get them. To drown her annoyance she said:
"They are still sour."

A mistress used to wake the Maids at night and, as soon as the cocks crowed, put them to work. The Maids found that hard, and decided to kill the Cock, so that the mistress should not be wakened. They killed him, but now they suffered more than ever: the mistress was afraid that she would sleep past the time and so began to wake the Maids earlier.
A Fisherman caught a Fish. Said the Fish:
"Fisherman, let me go into the water; you see I am small: you will have little profit of me. If you let me go, I shall grow up, and then you will catch me when it will be worth while."
But the Fisherman said:
"A fool would be he who should wait for greater profit, and let the lesser slip out of his hands."

A Goat wanted to drink. He went down the incline to the well, drank his fill, and gained in weight. He started to get out, but could not do so. He began to bleat. A Fox saw him and said:
"That's it, stupid one! If you had as much sense in your head as there are hairs in your beard, you would have thought of how to get out before you climbed down."

A Dog was crossing the river over a plank, carrying a piece of meat in her teeth. She saw herself in the water and thought that another dog was carrying a piece of meat. She dropped her piece and dashed forward to take away what the other dog had: the other meat was gone, and her own was carried away by the stream.
And thus the Dog was left without anything.

A peasant put out his nets to catch the Cranes for tramping down his field. In the nets were caught the Cranes, and with them one Stork.
The Stork said to the peasant:
"Let me go! I am not a Crane, but a Stork; we are most honoured birds; I live on your father's house. You can see by my feathers that I am not a Crane."
The peasant said:
"With the Cranes I have caught you, and with them will I kill you."

A Gardener wanted his Sons to get used to gardening. As he was dying, he called them up and said to them:
"Children, when I am dead, look for what is hidden in the vineyard."
The Sons thought that it was a treasure, and when their father died, they began to dig there, and dug up the whole ground. They did not find the treasure, but they ploughed the vineyard up so well that it brought forth more fruit than ever.

A Wolf had a bone stuck in his throat, and could not cough it up. He called the Crane, and said to him:
"Crane, you have a long neck. Thrust your head into my throat and draw out the bone! I will reward you."
The Crane stuck his head in, pulled out the bone, and said:
"Give me my reward!"
The Wolf gnashed his teeth and said:
"Is it not enough reward for you that I did not bite off your head when it was between my teeth?"

The Hares once got together, and began to complain about their life:
"We perish from men, and from dogs, and from eagles, and from all the other beasts. It would be better to die at once than to live in fright and suffer. Come, let us drown ourselves!"
And the Hares raced away to drown themselves in a lake. The Frogs heard the Hares and plumped into the water. So one of the Hares said:
"Wait, boys! Let us put off the drowning! Evidently the Frogs are having a harder life than we: they are afraid even of us."

A Father told his Sons to live in peace: they paid no attention to him. So he told them to bring the bath broom, and said:
"Break it!"
No matter how much they tried, they could not break it. Then the Father unclosed the broom, and told them to break the rods singly. They broke it.
The Father said:
"So it is with you: if you live in peace, no one will overcome you; but if you quarrel, and are divided, any one will easily ruin you."

A Fox got caught in a trap. She tore off her tail, and got away. She began to contrive how to cover up her shame. She called together the Foxes, and begged them to cut off their tails.
"A tail," she said, "is a useless thing. In vain do we drag along a dead weight."
One of the Foxes said:
"You would not be speaking thus, if you were not tailless!"
The tailless Fox grew silent and went away.

A Wild Ass saw a Tame Ass. The Wild Ass went up to him and began to praise his life, saying how smooth his body was, and what sweet feed he received. Later, when the Tame Ass was loaded down, and a driver began to goad him with a stick, the Wild Ass said:
"No, brother, I do not envy you: I see that your life is going hard with you."

A Stag went to the brook to quench his thirst. He saw himself in the water, and began to admire his horns, seeing how large and branching they were; and he looked at his feet, and said: "But my feet are unseemly and thin."
Suddenly a Lion sprang out and made for the Stag. The Stag started to run over the open plain. He was getting away, but there came a forest, and his horns caught in the branches, and the lion caught him. As the Stag was dying, he said:
"How foolish I am! That which I thought to be unseemly and thin was saving me, and what I gloried in has been my ruin."

A Dog fell asleep back of the yard. A Wolf ran up and wanted to eat him.
Said the Dog:
"Wolf, don't eat me yet: now I am lean and bony. Wait a little,—my master is going to celebrate a wedding; then I shall have plenty to eat; I shall grow fat. It will be better to eat me then."
The Wolf believed her, and went away. Then he came a second time, and saw the Dog lying on the roof. The Wolf said to her:
"Well, have they had the wedding?"
The Dog replied:
"Listen, Wolf! If you catch me again asleep in front of the yard, do not wait for the wedding."

A Gnat came to a Lion, and said:
"Do you think that you have more strength than I? You are mistaken! What does your strength consist in? Is it that you scratch with your claws, and gnaw with your teeth? That is the way the women quarrel with their husbands. I am stronger than you: if you wish let us fight!"
And the Gnat sounded his horn, and began to bite the Lion on his bare cheeks and his nose. The Lion struck his face with his paws and scratched it with his claws. He tore his face until the blood came, and gave up.
The Gnat trumpeted for joy, and flew away. Then he became entangled in a spider's web, and the spider began to suck him up. The Gnat said:
"I have vanquished the strong beast, the Lion, and now I perish from this nasty spider."

A gardener had a Horse. She had much to do, but little to eat; so she began to pray to God to get another master. And so it happened. The gardener sold the Horse to a potter. The Horse was glad, but the potter had even more work for her to do. And again the Horse complained of her lot, and began to pray that she might get a better master. And this prayer, too, was fulfilled. The potter sold the Horse to a tanner. When the Horse saw the skins of horses in the tanner's yard, she began to cry:
"Woe to me, wretched one! It would be better if I could stay with my old masters. It is evident they have sold me now not for work, but for my skin's sake."

An Old Man cut some wood, which he carried away. He had to carry it far. He grew tired, so he put down his bundle, and said:
"Oh, if Death would only come!"
Death came, and said:
"Here I am, what do you want?"
The Old Man was frightened, and said:
"Lift up my bundle!"

A Lion, growing old, was unable to catch the animals, and so intended to live by cunning. He went into a den, lay down there, and pretended that he was sick. The animals came to see him, and he ate up those that went into his den. The Fox guessed the trick. She stood at the entrance of the den, and said:
"Well, Lion, how are you feeling?"
The Lion answered:
"Poorly. Why don't you come in?"
The Fox replied:
"I do not come in because I see by the tracks that many have entered, but none have come out."

A Stag hid himself from the hunters in a vineyard. When the hunters missed him, the Stag began to nibble at the grape-vine leaves.
The hunters noticed that the leaves were moving, and so they thought, "There must be an animal under those leaves," and fired their guns, and wounded the Stag.
The Stag said, dying:
"It serves me right for wanting to eat the leaves that saved me."

A house was overrun with Mice. A Cat found his way into the house, and began to catch them. The Mice saw that matters were bad, and said:
"Mice, let us not come down from the ceiling! The Cat cannot get up there."
When the Mice stopped coming down, the Cat decided that he must catch them by a trick. He grasped the ceiling with one leg, hung down from it, and made believe that he was dead.
A Mouse looked out at him, but said:
"No, my friend! Even if you should turn into a bag, I would not go up to you."

A Wolf saw a Goat browsing on a rocky mountain, and he could not get at her; so he said to her:
"Come down lower! The place is more even, and the grass is much sweeter to feed on."
But the Goat answered:
"You are not calling me down for that, Wolf: you are troubling yourself not about my food, but about yours."

The Olive-tree and the Reeds quarrelled about who was stronger and sounder. The Olive-tree laughed at the Reeds because they bent in every wind. The Reeds kept silence. A storm came: the Reeds swayed, tossed, bowed to the ground,—and remained unharmed. The Olive-tree strained her branches against the wind,—and broke.
Two Companions were walking through the forest when a Bear jumped out on them. One started to run, climbed a tree, and hid himself, but the other remained in the road. He had nothing to do, so he fell down on the ground and pretended that he was dead.
The Bear went up to him, and sniffed at him; but he had stopped breathing.
The Bear sniffed at his face; he thought that he was dead, and so went away.
When the Bear was gone, the Companion climbed down from the tree and laughing, said: "What did the Bear whisper in your ear?"
"He told me that those who in danger run away from their companions are bad people."

A Wolf saw a Lamb drinking at a river. The Wolf wanted to eat the Lamb, and so he began to annoy him. He said:
"You are muddling my water and do not let me drink."
The Lamb said:
"How can I muddle your water? I am standing downstream from you; besides, I drink with the tips of my lips."
And the Wolf said:
"Well, why did you call my father names last summer?"
The Lamb said:
"But, Wolf, I was not yet born last summer."
The Wolf got angry, and said:
"It is hard to get the best of you. Besides, my stomach is empty, so I will devour you."

An old, sick Lion was lying in his den. All the animals came to see the king, but the Fox kept away. So the Wolf was glad of the chance, and began to slander the Fox before the Lion.
"She does not esteem you in the least," he said, "she has not come once to see the king."
The Fox happened to run by as he was saying these words. She heard what the Wolf had said, and thought:
"Wait, Wolf, I will get my revenge on you."
So the Lion began to roar at the Fox, but she said:
"Do not have me killed, but let me say a word! I did not come to see you because I had no time. And I had no time because I ran over the whole world to ask the doctors for a remedy for you. I have just got it, and so I have come to see you."
The Lion said:
"What is the remedy?"
"It is this: if you flay a live Wolf, and put his warm hide on you—"
When the Lion stretched out the Wolf, the Fox laughed, and said:
"That's it, my friend: masters ought to be led to do good, not evil."

The Lion, the Ass, and the Fox went out to hunt. They caught a large number of animals, and the Lion told the Ass to divide them up. The Ass divided them into three equal parts and said: "Now, take them!"
The Lion grew angry, ate up the Ass, and told the Fox to divide them up anew. The Fox collected them all into one heap, and left a small bit for herself. The Lion looked at it and said:
"Clever Fox! Who taught you to divide so well?"
She said:
"What about that Ass?"

A Peasant lost his axe in the river; he sat down on the bank in grief, and began to weep.
The Water-sprite heard the Peasant and took pity on him. He brought a gold axe out of the river, and said: "Is this your axe?"
The Peasant said: "No, it is not mine."
The Water-sprite brought another, a silver axe.
Again the Peasant said: "It is not my axe."
Then the Water-sprite brought out the real axe.
The Peasant said: "Now this is my axe."
The Water-sprite made the Peasant a present of all three axes, for having told the truth.
At home the Peasant showed his axes to his friends, and told them what had happened to him.
One of the peasants made up his mind to do the same: he went to the river, purposely threw his axe into the water, sat down on the bank, and began to weep.
The Water-sprite brought out a gold axe, and asked: "Is this your axe?"
The Peasant was glad, and called out: "It is mine, mine!"
The Water-sprite did not give him the gold axe, and did not bring him back his own either, because he had told an untruth.

A Raven got himself a piece of meat, and sat down on a tree. The Fox wanted to get it from him. She went up to him, and said:
"Oh, Raven, as I look at you,—from your size and beauty,—you ought to be a king! And you would certainly be a king, if you had a good voice."
The Raven opened his mouth wide, and began to croak with all his might and main. The meat fell down. The Fox caught it and said:
"Oh, Raven! If you had also sense, you would certainly be a king."

There was once a merchant that had three daughters, and he loved them better than himself. Now it happened that he had to go a long journey to buy some goods, and when he was just starting he said to them, "What shall I bring you back, my dears?"
And the eldest daughter asked to have a necklace; and the second daughter wished to have a gold chain; but the youngest daughter said, "Bring back yourself, papa, and that is what I want the most."
"Nonsense, child," said her father, "you must say something that I may remember to bring back for you."
"So," she said, "then bring me back a rose, father."
Well, the merchant went on his journey and did his business and bought a pearl necklace for his eldest daughter, and a gold chain for his second daughter; but he knew it was no use getting a rose for the youngest while he was so far away because it would fade before he got home. So he made up his mind he would get a rose for her the day he got near his house.
When all his merchanting was done he rode off home and forgot all about the rose till he was near his house; then he suddenly remembered what he had promised his youngest daughter, and looked about to see if he could find a rose. Near where he had stopped he saw a great garden, and getting off his horse he wandered about in it till he found a lovely rosebush; and he plucked the most beautiful rose he could see on it. At that moment he heard a crash like thunder, and looking around he saw a huge monster -- two tusks in his mouth and fiery eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back.
"Mortal," said the beast, "who told you you might pluck my roses?"
"Please, sir," said the merchant in fear and terror for his life, "I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment, and then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission."
"Thieving is thieving," said the beast, "whether it be a rose or a diamond; your life is forfeit."
The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but him to support them.
"Well, mortal, well," said the beast, "I grant your life on one condition: Seven days from now you must bring this youngest daughter of yours, for whose sake you have broken into my garden, and leave her here in your stead. Otherwise swear that you will return and place yourself at my disposal."
So the merchant swore, and taking his rose mounted his horse and rode home.
As soon as he got into his house his daughters came rushing round him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way, and soon he gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the chain to his second daughter, and then he gave the rose to his youngest, and as he gave it he sighed.
"Oh, thank you, father," they all cried.
But the youngest said, "Why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?"
"Later on I will tell you," said the merchant.
So for several days they lived happily together, though the merchant wandered about gloomy and sad, and nothing his daughters could do would cheer him up till at last he took his youngest daughter aside and said to her, "Bella, do you love your father?"
"Of course I do, father, of course I do."
"Well, now you have a chance of showing it"; and then he told her of all that had occurred with the beast when he got the rose for her. Bella was very sad, as you can well think, and then she said, "Oh, father, it was all on account of me that you fell into the power of this beast; so I will go with you to him; perhaps he will do me no harm; but even if he does -- better harm to me than evil to my dear father."
So next day the merchant took Bella behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the dwelling of the beast. And when he got there and they alighted from his horse the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there! Nothing. So they went up the steps and went through the hall, and went into the dining room, and there they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and napery, with plenty to eat upon it. So they waited and they waited, thinking that the owner of the house would appear, till at last the merchant said, "Let's sit down and see what will happen then." And when they sat down invisible hands passed them things to eat and to drink, and they ate and drank to their heart's content. And when they arose from the table it arose too and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants.
Suddenly there appeared before them the beast who said to the merchant, "Is this your youngest daughter?"
And when he had said that it was, he said, "Is she willing to stop here with me?"
And then he looked at Bella who said, in a trembling voice, "Yes, sir."
"Well, no harm shall befall you." With that he led the merchant down to his horse and told him he might come that day each week to visit his daughter. Then the beast returned to Bella and said to her, "This house with all that therein is is yours; if you desire aught, clap your hands and say the word and it shall be brought unto you." And with that he made a sort of bow and went away.
So Bella lived on in the home with the beast and was waited on by invisible servants and had whatever she liked to eat and to drink; but she soon got tired of the solitude and, next day, when the beast came to her, though he looked so terrible, she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. So they spoke together about the garden and about the house and about her father's business and about all manner of things, so that Bella lost altogether her fear of the beast. Shortly afterwards her father came to see her and found her quite happy, and he felt much less dread of her fate at the hands of the beast.
So it went on for many days, Bella seeing and talking to the beast every day, till she got quite to like him, until one day the beast did not come at his usual time, just after the midday meal, and Bella quite missed him. So she wandered about the garden trying to find him, calling out his name, but received no reply. At last she came to the rosebush from which her father had plucked the rose, and there, under it, what do you think she saw! There was the beast lying huddled up without any life or motion. Then Bella was sorry indeed and remembered all the kindness that the beast had shown her; and she threw herself down by it and said, "Oh, Beast, Beast, why did you die? I was getting to love you so much."
No sooner had she said this than the hide of the beast split in two and out came the most handsome young prince who told her that he had been enchanted by a magician and that he could not recover his natural form unless a maiden should, of her own accord, declare that she loved him.
Thereupon the prince sent for the merchant and his daughters, and he was married to Bella, and they all lived happy together ever afterwards.

Once there were two brothers, both named Peter; the older one was called Big Peter, and the younger one Little Peter. When their father died, Big Peter took over the farm and found himself a wealthy wife. Little Peter, however, stayed at home with his mother, and lived from her pension until he came of age. Then he received his inheritance, and Big Peter said that he could stay in the old house no longer, living from his mother. It would be better for him to go out into the world and do something for himself.
Little Peter agreed; so he bought himself a fine horse and a load of butter and cheese, and set off to the town. With the money he got for his goods he bought brandy and other drinks, and as soon as he arrived home, he threw a great feast, inviting all of his relatives and acquaintances. They in turn invited him for drinking and merrymaking. Thus he lived in fun and frolic so long as his money lasted. But when his last farthing was spent, and Little Peter found himself sitting high and dry, he went back home again to his old mother, and there he had nothing but one calf. When spring came he turned out the calf and let it graze on Big Peter's meadow. But this made Big Peter angry, and he struck the calf, killing it. Little Peter skinned the calf, and hung the hide up in the bathroom until it was thoroughly dry; then he rolled it up, stuffed it into a sack, and went about the area trying to sell it; but wherever he went, people only laughed at him, saying that they had no need of smoked calfskin. After walking a long way, he came to a farm, where he asked for a night's lodging.
"No," said the old woman of the house, "I can't give you lodging, for my husband is at the hut in the upper pasture, and I'm alone in the house. You will have to ask for shelter at the next farm; but if they won't take you in, you may come back, because you can't spend the night out of doors."
As Peter passed by the living-room window, he saw that there was a priest in there, whom the woman was entertaining. She was serving him ale and brandy, and a large bowl of custard. But just as the priest had sat down to eat and drink, the husband came back home. The woman heard him in the hallway, and she was not slow; she put the bowl of custard under the fireplace mantel, the ale and brandy into the cellar, and as for the priest, she locked him inside a large chest that was there. Little Peter was standing outside the whole time and saw everything. As soon as the husband had entered, Little Peter went to the door and asked if he might have a night's lodging.
"Yes," said the man, "you can stay here," and he asked Little Peter to sit down at the table and eat. Little Peter sat down, taking his calfskin with him, which he laid under his feet.
When they had sat a while, Little Peter began to step on the skin.
"What are you saying now? Can't you be quiet?" said Little Peter.
"Who are you talking to?" asked the man.
"Oh," answered Little Peter, "it's only the fortuneteller that I have here in my calfskin."
"And what does she foretell?" asked the man.
"Why, she says that there is a bowl of custard under the fireplace mantel," said Little Peter.
"Her prediction is wrong," answered the man. "We haven't had custard in this house for a year and a day."
But Peter asked him to take a look; he did so and found the custard. So they proceeded to enjoy it, but just as they were eating, Peter stepped on the calfskin again.
"Hush!" he said, "can't you hold your mouth?"
"What is the fortuneteller saying now?" asked the man.
"Oh, she says there is probably some ale and brandy just under the cellar door," answered Peter.
"Well, if she never predicted wrong in her life, she's predicting wrong now," said the man. "Ale and brandy! We have never had such things in the house!"
"Just take a look," said Peter. The man did so, and there, sure enough, he found the drinks, and was very pleased indeed.
"How much did you pay for that fortuneteller?" said the man, "for I must have her, whatever you ask for her."
"I inherited her from my father, and never thought that she was worth much," answered Peter. "Of course, I am not eager to part with her, but you may have her nonetheless, if you'll give me that old chest in the living room."
"The chest is locked and the key is lost," cried the old woman.
"Then I'll take it without the key," said Peter, and he and the man quickly struck the bargain.
Peter got a rope instead of the key. The man helped him load the chest onto his back, and off he stumbled with it. After he had walked a while, he came to a bridge. Beneath the bridge ran a raging stream, foaming, gurgling, and roaring until the bridge shook.
"That brandy, that brandy!" said Peter. Now I can tell that I've had too much. Why should I be dragging this chest about? If I hadn't been drunk and crazy, I would not have traded my fortuneteller for it. But now this chest is going into the river, and quickly!"
And with that he began to untie the rope.
"Au! Au! For God's sake save me. It is the priest that you have in the chest," screamed someone from inside.
"That must be the devil himself," said Peter, "and he wants to make me believe he has become a priest; but whether he claims to be a priest or a sexton, into the river he goes!"
"Oh, no! Oh no! I am in truth the parish priest. I was visiting the woman for her soul's health, but her husband is rough and wild, so she had to hide me in the chest. I have a silver watch and a gold watch with me. You can have them both, and eight hundred dollars beside, if you will only let me out," cried the priest.
"Oh, no!" said Peter. "Is it really your reverence after all?" With that he picked up a stone, and knocked the lid of the chest into pieces. The priest got out and ran home to his parsonage quickly and lightly, for he no longer had his watches and money to weigh him down.
Then Little Peter went home and said to Big Peter, "Today at the market there was a good price for calfskins."
"What did you get for your shabby one?" asked Big Peter.
"Shabby as it was, I got eight hundred dollars for it, but those from larger and fatter calves were bringing twice as much," said Little Peter, and showed his money.
"It is good that you told me this," answered Big Peter. He then slaughtered all his cows and calves, and set off to town with their skins and hides. When he arrived at the market, and the tanners asked what he wanted for his hides, Big Peter said "eight hundred dollars for the small ones, and more for the big ones." But they all laughed at him and made fun of him, and said he should not have come there, that he could get a better bargain at the madhouse. Thus he soon found out that Little Peter had tricked him.
But when he got home again he was not very gentle; he swore and cursed, threatening to strike Little Peter dead that very night. Little Peter stood and listened to all this. After he had gone to bed with his mother, and the night had worn on a little, he asked her to change sides with him, saying that he was cold and that it would be warmer next to the wall. Yes, she did that, and a little later Big Peter came with an ax in his hand, crept up to the bedside, and with one blow chopped off his mother's head.
The next morning, Little Peter went into Big Peter's room.
"Heaven help you," he said. "You have chopped our mother's head off. The sheriff will not be pleased to hear that you are paying mother's pension in this way."
Then Big Peter became terribly frightened, and he begged Little Peter, for God's sake, to say nothing about what he knew. If he would only keep still, he should have eight hundred dollars.
Well, Little Peter swept up the money; set his mother's head on her body again; put her on a sled, and pulled her to market. There he set her up with an apple basket on each arm, and an apple in each hand. By and by a skipper came walking along; he thought she was a market woman, and asked if she had apples to sell, and how many he might have for a penny. But the old woman did not answer. So the skipper asked again. No! She said nothing.
"How many may I have for a penny?" he cried the third time, but the old woman sat there, as though she neither saw nor heard him. Then the skipper flew into a rage and slapped her, causing her head to roll across the marketplace. At that moment, Little Peter came running. Weeping and wailing, and threatened to make trouble for the skipper, for having killed his old mother.
"Dear friend, keep still about what you know," said the skipper, "and I'll give you eight hundred dollars," and thus they made a deal.
When Little Peter got home again, he said to Big Peter, "Old women were bringing a good price at the market today; I got eight hundred dollars for our mother," and he showed him the money.
"It is good that I came to know this," said Big Peter. He had an old mother-in-law, and he killed her, and then set forth to sell her. But when people heard how he was trying to sell dead bodies, they wanted to hand him over to the sheriff, and it was all he could do to escape.
When Big Peter arrived home again, he was so angry with Little Peter, that he threatened to strike him dead there and then, without mercy.
"Yes, indeed" said Little Peter, "we must all go this way, and between today and tomorrow there is only the night. But if I must set off now, I've only one thing to ask; put me into that sack that's hanging over there, and carry me to the river."
Big Peter had nothing against that; he stuffed him into the sack, and set off. But he hadn't gone far before it came into his mind that he had forgotten something which he had to go back and fetch; meanwhile, he set the sack down by the side of the road. Just then came a man driving a big flock of fine sheep,
To the Kingdom of Heaven, to Paradise.
To the Kingdom of Heaven, to Paradise!
cried out Little Peter from inside the sack, and he kept mumbling and muttering the same words over and over.
"May I not go with you?" asked the man with the sheep.
"Of course you may," said Little Peter. "Just untie the sack, and trade places with me, and you'll get there enough. I can wait until next time. But you must keep on calling out what I was saying, or you'll not go to the right place."
Then the man untied the sack, and took Little Peter's place. Peter tied the sack up again, and the man began to cry out,
To the Kingdom of Heaven, to Paradise.
To the Kingdom of Heaven, to Paradise!
and repeated the saying over and over again.
After Peter got him positioned in the sack, he wasn't slow; off he went with the flock of sheep, making a broad turn. Meantime, Big Peter, returned, took the sack on his shoulders, and carried it to the river, and all the while he went, the shepherd sat inside crying:
To the Kingdom of Heaven, to Paradise!
"Yes, indeed! Now try now to find the way for yourself," said Big Peter, and with that he tossed him out into the stream.
When Big Peter had done that, and was going back home, he met his brother, who was driving the flock of sheep before him. Big Peter could hardly believe his eyes, and asked how Little Peter had gotten out of the river, and where he had found the fine flock of sheep.
"That was an act of brotherly love that you did for me when you threw me into the river," answered Little Peter. I sank right down to the bottom like a stone, and there I saw flocks of sheep, believe me. Down there they go about by the thousands; each flock is finer than the others. And just see what splendid wool they have!"
That is good of you to tell me that, said Big Peter. Then he ran home to his wife; made her come with him to the river; crept into a sack, and asked her to quickly tie it up, and throw him over the bridge.
"I'm going after a flock of sheep," he said. "If I stay too long, it's because I can't manage the flock by myself; then you'll have to jump in and help me."
"Well, don't stay too long," said his wife, "for I am looking forward to those sheep."
She stood there and waited a while, but then she thought that her husband couldn't gather the flock together, and so she jumped in after him.
Now Little Peter was rid of them all, and he inherited their farm and fields, and horses and tools too; and besides, he had money enough to buy cattle as well.

Many years ago there lived an emperor who loved beautiful new clothes so much that he spent all his money on being finely dressed. His only interest was in going to the theater or in riding about in his carriage where he could show off his new clothes. He had a different costume for every hour of the day. Indeed, where it was said of other kings that they were at court, it could only be said of him that he was in his dressing room!
One day two swindlers came to the emperor's city. They said that they were weavers, claiming that they knew how to make the finest cloth imaginable. Not only were the colors and the patterns extraordinarily beautiful, but in addition, this material had the amazing property that it was to be invisible to anyone who was incompetent or stupid.
"It would be wonderful to have clothes made from that cloth," thought the emperor. "Then I would know which of my men are unfit for their positions, and I'd also be able to tell clever people from stupid ones." So he immediately gave the two swindlers a great sum of money to weave their cloth for him.
They set up their looms and pretended to go to work, although there was nothing at all on the looms. They asked for the finest silk and the purest gold, all of which they hid away, continuing to work on the empty looms, often late into the night.
"I would really like to know how they are coming with the cloth!" thought the emperor, but he was a bit uneasy when he recalled that anyone who was unfit for his position or stupid would not be able to see the material. Of course, he himself had nothing to fear, but still he decided to send someone else to see how the work was progressing.
"I'll send my honest old minister to the weavers," thought the emperor. He's the best one to see how the material is coming. He is very sensible, and no one is more worthy of his position than he.
So the good old minister went into the hall where the two swindlers sat working at their empty looms. "Goodness!" thought the old minister, opening his eyes wide. "I cannot see a thing!" But he did not say so.
The two swindlers invited him to step closer, asking him if it wasn't a beautiful design and if the colors weren't magnificent. They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister opened his eyes wider and wider. He still could see nothing, for nothing was there. "Gracious" he thought. "Is it possible that I am stupid? I have never thought so. Am I unfit for my position? No one must know this. No, it will never do for me to say that I was unable to see the material."
"You aren't saying anything!" said one of the weavers.
"Oh, it is magnificent! The very best!" said the old minister, peering through his glasses. "This pattern and these colors! Yes, I'll tell the emperor that I am very satisfied with it!"
"That makes us happy!" said the two weavers, and they called the colors and the unusual pattern by name. The old minister listened closely so that he would be able say the same things when he reported back to the emperor, and that is exactly what he did.
The swindlers now asked for more money, more silk, and more gold, all of which they hid away. Then they continued to weave away as before on the empty looms.
The emperor sent other officials as well to observe the weavers' progress. They too were startled when they saw nothing, and they too reported back to him how wonderful the material was, advising him to have it made into clothes that he could wear in a grand procession. The entire city was alive in praise of the cloth. "Magnifique! Nysseligt! Excellent!" they said, in all languages. The emperor awarded the swindlers with medals of honor, bestowing on each of them the title Lord Weaver.
The swindlers stayed up the entire night before the procession was to take place, burning more than sixteen candles. Everyone could see that they were in a great rush to finish the emperor's new clothes. They pretended to take the material from the looms. They cut in the air with large scissors. They sewed with needles but without any thread. Finally they announced, "Behold! The clothes are finished!"
The emperor came to them with his most distinguished cavaliers. The two swindlers raised their arms as though they were holding something and said, "Just look at these trousers! Here is the jacket! This is the cloak!" and so forth. "They are as light as spider webs! You might think that you didn't have a thing on, but that is the good thing about them."
"Yes," said the cavaliers, but they couldn't see a thing, for nothing was there.
"Would his imperial majesty, if it please his grace, kindly remove his clothes." said the swindlers. "Then we will fit you with the new ones, here in front of the large mirror."
The emperor took off all his clothes, and the swindlers pretended to dress him, piece by piece, with the new ones that were to be fitted. They took hold of his waist and pretended to tie something about him. It was the train. Then the emperor turned and looked into the mirror.
"Goodness, they suit you well! What a wonderful fit!" they all said. "What a pattern! What colors! Such luxurious clothes!"
"The canopy to be carried above your majesty awaits outside," said the grandmaster of ceremonies.
"Yes, I am ready!" said the emperor. "Don't they fit well?" He turned once again toward the mirror, because it had to appear as though he were admiring himself in all his glory.
The chamberlains who were to carry the train held their hands just above the floor as if they were picking up the train. As they walked they pretended to hold the train high, for they could not let anyone notice that they could see nothing.
The emperor walked beneath the beautiful canopy in the procession, and all the people in the street and in their windows said, "Goodness, the emperor's new clothes are incomparable! What a beautiful train on his jacket. What a perfect fit!" No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid. None of the emperor's clothes had ever before received such praise.
"But he doesn't have anything on!" said a small child.
"Good Lord, let us hear the voice of an innocent child!" said the father, and whispered to another what the child had said.
"A small child said that he doesn't have anything on!"
Finally everyone was saying, "He doesn't have anything on!"
The emperor shuddered, for he knew that they were right, but he thought, "The procession must go on!" He carried himself even more proudly, and the chamberlains walked along behind carrying the train that wasn't there.

A peasant left a jug of milk with a neighbor for safekeeping. When he reclaimed the jug, the milk had disappeared. Angry words led to a lawsuit, and the judge decreed that the neighbor should pay for the milk, even though the latter claimed that the flies had consumed it.
"You should have struck them dead," said the judge.
"What?" replied the peasant, "You grant me permission to kill flies?"
"Yes indeed," responded the judge. "You have my permission to kill them anywhere you find them."
In that moment the peasant saw a fly on the judge's cheek. He stepped up to him and gave him a slap, saying, "I bet that cursed fly is one of those who drank up the milk!"
Because of the permission he had granted the peasant, the judge could do nothing about the slap.

There was a king who lived happily with his daughter, his only child. Quite suddenly the princess had a baby, but no one knew who the father was. For some time the king was beside himself. Finally he ordered the princess to take the child to the church. A lemon would be placed in his hand, and whoever he should give it to would be the child's father and the princess's husband. This happened, but only fine people were admitted into the church. However, in the town there was a small, crooked, hunchbacked lad who was not very smart and who was therefore known as Hans Dumb. He mingled with the others and slipped into the church without being seen. When the child reached out with the lemon, it was to Hans Dumb!
The princess was horrified, and the king was so taken aback that he had her, the child, and Hans Dumb placed into a cask and set adrift at sea. The cask soon drifted away, and when they were alone at sea the princess cried out bitterly, "You horrid, hunchbacked, impudent rogue, you are the cause of my suffering. Why did you force your way into the church? You have nothing to do with the child."
"Oh yes," said Hans Dumb. "I have a lot to do with it, because one day I wished that you would have a child, and my wishes come true."
"If that is so, then wish us something to eat."
"I can do that too," said Hans Dumb, and he wished for a plate filled with potatoes. The princess would have liked something better, but because she was so hungry she helped him eat the potatoes.
After they had eaten their fill, Hans Dumb said, "Now I shall wish us a fine ship!" He had scarcely said this and they were sitting in a splendid ship, with an excess of everything that they might want.
The helmsman steered straight for land, and as they were going ashore Hans Dumb said, "Here there shall be a castle!" And there was a splendid castle there, and servants dressed in gold came and led the princess and the child inside, and when they were in the middle of the great hall, Hans Dumb said, "Now I wish to become a young and intelligent prince!" Then his hump disappeared, and he was handsome and straight and friendly. He found favor with the princess, and he became her husband, and they lived happily for a long time.
One day the old king got lost while out riding and came to their castle. He was amazed, because he had never seen it before, and he went inside. The princess recognized her father at once, but he did not know who she was, for he thought that she had long since drowned in the ocean. She received him with splendor, but when he wanted to go back home, she secretly placed a golden goblet into his pocket.
After he had ridden away she sent some knights after him to stop him and see if he hadn't stolen the golden goblet. They found it in his pocket and brought him back. He swore to the princess that he had not stolen it and did not know how it came to be in his pocket.
She said, "You see, one should always be cautious about accusing another person." With this she revealed herself as his daughter. The king was overjoyed, and they lived happily together, and after his death Hans Dumb became king.

Once upon a time there was a princess who went out into a forest and sat next to a cool well. She took great pleasure in throwing a golden ball into the air and catching it, but once it went too high. She held out her hand with her fingers curved to catch it, but it fell to the ground and rolled and rolled right into the water.
Horrified, the princess followed it with her eyes, but the well was so deep that she could not see its bottom. Then she began to cry bitterly, "I'd give anything, if only I could get my ball back: my clothes, my precious stones, my pearls, anything in the world." At this a frog stuck his head out of the water and said, "Princess, why are you crying so bitterly?"
"Oh," she said, "you ugly frog, how can you help me? My golden ball has fallen into the well."
The frog said, "I do not want your pearls, your precious stones, and your clothes, but if you'll accept me as a companion and let me sit next to you and eat from your plate and sleep in your bed, and if you'll love and cherish me, then I'll bring your ball back to you."
The princess thought, "What is this stupid frog trying to say? After all, he does have to stay here in the water. But still, maybe he can get my ball. I'll go ahead and say yes," and she said aloud, "Yes, for all I care. Just bring me back my golden ball, and I'll promise everything."
The frog stuck his head under the water and dove to the bottom. He returned a short time later with the golden ball in his mouth and threw it onto the land. When the princess saw her ball once again, she rushed toward it, picked it up, and was so happy to have it in her hand again, that she could think of nothing else than to run home with it. The frog called after her, "Wait, princess, take me with you like you promised," but she paid no attention to him.
The next day the princess was sitting at her table when she heard something coming up the marble steps: plop, plop. Then there came a knock at the door, and a voice called out, "Princess, princess, open the door for me!" She ran and opened the door. It was the frog, whom she had put completely out of her mind. Frightened, she slammed the door shut and returned to the table.
The king saw that her heart was pounding and asked, "Why are you afraid?"
"There is a disgusting frog out there," she said, "who got my golden ball out of the water. I promised him that he could be my companion, but I didn't think that he could leave his water, but now he is just outside the door and wants to come in." Just then there came a second knock at the door, and a voice called out:
Youngest daughter of the king,
Open up the door for me,
Don't you know what yesterday,
You said to me down by the well?
Youngest daughter of the king,
Open up the door for me,
The king said, "What you have promised, you must keep. Go and let the frog in." She obeyed, and the frog hopped in, then followed her up to her chair.
After she had sat down again, he called out, "Lift me up onto your chair and let me sit next to you." The princess did not want to, but the king commanded her to do it. When the frog was seated next to her he said, "Now push your golden plate closer. I want to eat from it." She had to do this as well. When he had eaten all he wanted, he said, "Now I am tired and want to sleep. Take me to your room, make your bed, so that we can lie in it together."
The princess was horrified when she heard that. She was afraid of the cold frog and did not dare to even touch him, and yet he was supposed to lie next to her in her bed; she began to cry and didn't want to at all. Then the king became angry and commanded her to do what she had promised. There was no helping it; she had to do what her father wanted, but in her heart she was bitterly angry. She picked up the frog with two fingers, carried him to her room, and climbed into bed, but instead of laying him next to herself, she threw him bang! against the wall. "Now you will leave me in peace, you ugly frog!" But when the frog came down onto the bed, he was a handsome young prince, and he was her dear companion, and she held him in esteem as she had promised, and they fell asleep together with pleasure.
The next morning the prince's faithful Heinrich arrived in a splendid carriage drawn by eight horses and decorated with feathers and glistening with gold. He had been so saddened by the prince's enchantment that he had had to place three iron bands around his heart to keep it from bursting in sorrow. The prince climbed into the carriage with the princess. His faithful servant stood at the rear to drive them to his kingdom. After they had gone a short distance, the prince heard a loud crack. He turned around and said:
"Heinrich, the carriage is breaking apart."
"No, my lord, the carriage it's not,
But one of the bands surrounding my heart,
That suffered such great pain,
When you were sitting in the well,
When you were a frog."
Once again, and then once again the prince heard a cracking sound and thought that the carriage was breaking apart, but it was the bands springing from faithful Heinrich's heart because his master was now redeemed and happy.

Once upon a time there was a king who had three daughters. In his courtyard there was a well with wonderful clear water. One hot summer day the oldest daughter went down and drew herself a glassful, but when she held it to the sun, she saw that it was cloudy. This seemed strange to her, and she was about to pour it back when a frog appeared in the water, stuck his head into the air, then jumped out onto the well's edge, saying:
If you will be my sweetheart dear,
Then I will give you water clear.
"Ugh! Who wants to be the sweetheart of an ugly frog!" exclaimed the princess and ran away. She told her sisters about the amazing frog down at the well who was making the water cloudy. The second one was curious, so she too went down and drew herself a glassful, but it was so cloudy that she could not drink it. Once again the frog appeared at the well's edge and said:
If you will be my sweetheart dear,
Then I will give you water clear.
"Not I!" said the princess, and ran away. Finally the third sister came and drew a glassful, but it was no better than before. The frog also said to her:
If you will be my sweetheart dear,
Then I will give you water clear.
"Why not! I'll be your sweetheart. Just give me some clean water," she said, while thinking, "There's no harm in this. You can promise him anything, for a stupid frog can never be your sweetheart."
The frog sprang back into the water, and when she drew another glassful it was so clear that the sun glistened in it with joy. She drank all she wanted and then took some up to her sisters, saying, "Why were you so stupid as to be afraid of a frog?"
The princess did not think anything more about it until that evening after she had gone to bed. Before she fell asleep she heard something scratching at the door and a voice singing:
Open up! Open up!
Youngest daughter of the king.
Remember that you promised me
While I was sitting in the well,
That you would be my sweetheart dear,
If I would give you water clear.
"Ugh! That's my boyfriend the frog," said the princess. "I promised, so I will have to open the door for him." She got up, opened the door a crack, and went back to bed. The frog hopped after her, then hopped onto her bed where he lay at her feet until the night was over and the morning dawned. Then he jumped down and disappeared out the door.
The next evening, when the princess once more had just gone to bed, he scratched and sang again at the door. The princess let him in, and he again lay at her feet until daylight came. He came again on the third evening, as on the two previous ones. "This is the last time that I'll let you in," said the princess. "It will not happen again in the future." Then the frog jumped under her pillow, and the princess fell asleep. She awoke in the morning, thinking that the frog would hop away once again, but now a beautiful young prince was standing before her. He told her that he had been an enchanted frog and that she had broken the spell by promising to be his sweetheart. Then they both went to the king who gave them his blessing, and they were married. The two other sisters were angry with themselves that they had not taken the frog for their sweetheart.

Many years ago an old soldier was discharged from the army. He received in consideration of his excellent and faithful service a small loaf of rye bread and three pennies, whereupon he was at liberty to go whither he pleased. As he was walking along the highroad, he met three men. The one carried shovel, the second a pickaxe, and the third a spade.
The soldier stopped, looked at them, and said, "Where are you going?"
"I will tell you," answered one of them. "Today there was buried a man who owed each of us one penny, and now we will dig him up, since we are determined upon getting our dues."
"What an idea!" returned the soldier. "You had better leave the dead man alone. At any rate, he is at present unable to pay you even one penny, so don't disturb his peace!"
"It is all very fine for you to talk," answered the man. "But we must have the money, and up he must come."
When the soldier felt that his fair words could not settle the matter, he said, "Here, I have two pennies. Will you take them and promise to leave the dead man undisturbed?"
"Two pennies are not to be refused," said the man again, "but they will pay only two of us. What can you give the third one, since he is bent upon having his share?"
As the soldier saw that there was no dealing with these three wretches, he resumed, "Since you are so desperately determined, here is my third and last penny. Take it, and be content."
Now all three were well satisfied, so they pursued their way with the three pennies in their pockets.
When the soldier had advanced a distance, a stranger came walking along. He looked rather pale, but saluted the soldier in a very civil manner, and followed him along the road without uttering a single sound.
At last they reached a church, and here the stranger turned to his companion, saying, "Let us walk in!"
The soldier looked wistfully at him, and answered, "That would not do. What business have we in the church at midnight?"
"I tell you," replied the stranger, "we must walk in!"
Upon this they entered the church and walked straight up to the altar. There was an old woman sitting with a burning light in her hand.
"Take a hair from her head, and smell at it!" commanded the stranger.
The soldier complied, but nothing remarkable happened. The stranger asked him to repeat the action, which he did; but there was no effect. The third time, however, when he tore a whole tuft of hair from the woman's head, she became so furious that she darted off, out above the church, carrying the whole leaden vault with her.
The two men went out of the church and down to the beach, where they found the whole leaden vault. Turning to the soldier, the stranger said, "Sit up. We will put to sea!"
"Is that so?" remarked the soldier, who understood nothing of all this. "I see no ship, however."
"Let me manage it all," says the stranger. "Just seat yourself by me on the vault! Beyond the sea there is a princess of whom it was predicted that she would be married only to a man who should come across the sea in a leaden ship. Here you will be able to make your fortune."
The leaden vault now floated out upon the open sea, and landed them safely on the other side. Great was the joy and happiness throughout the country, and the marriage between the soldier and the princess was celebrated with such pomp and splendor as was never seen, before or after.
When the ceremony had been performed, and the carriage was standing in front of the church door, bride and groom entered, with the stranger who had followed the soldier all along. The coachman asked to what place he might drive them.
"Drive away, as fast as you can, towards the side where the sun will rise," said the stranger, and in a little while they were carried along at a furious rate.
Somewhere they saw a large herd of cattle. They stopped, and the soldier called the herdsman to the carriage door, asking who he was. "I am the Count of Ravensburg," answered the shepherd, "and yonder is my castle."
The stranger again bid the coachman drive as fast as possible. In a little while they rushed up to Ravensburg Castle. As they were ready to alight from the carriage, there was someone who knocked hard at the gate. It was the herdsman, who was anxious to come in. The stranger walked to the gate, inquiring what, he could do for him. He wished to come into the castle, he said, for it belonged to him, and he had a right to demand admittance. The stranger meditated a little, whereupon he told the herdsman, who was a conjurer, that he might be allowed to come in, but first he must suffer the whole fate of the rye.
"The fate of the rye!" repeated the conjurer. "What do you mean by that?"
"I mean," answered the stranger, "that next fall you must be sown deep in the ground, and towards spring, when you come up, you must ripen in the sunshine and grow in the rain until you are ready for the harvest. Then you will be mowed and dried, and kept in the barn, until at length you will be threshed."
"How is that!" cried the conjurer. "Am I to be threshed?"
"Of course you are," replied the stranger. "First you will be threshed, and then taken to the mill and ground."
"Ground, too!" shouted the conjurer. "Will I be ground also?"
"Yes, both ground and sifted," answered the stranger.
But the conjurer, hearing this, became so furious that he burst all into flint-stones.
The stranger now bid good-bye to the princess and the soldier, shook hands with them, and said, "Now I have seen you married to the princess. The troll of Ravensburg is dead and gone, and his castle, with all its treasures, is yours. I was as good to you as you were to me when you gave away your three pennies for my sake!"
"What do you say?" exclaimed the soldier. "I never thought of those three pennies again!"
"I know that," answered the stranger, "and otherwise I would not have been able to help you. However, I bid farewell to you and your, wife, for I must return to the place where I belong."

Once upon a time there was a child who was willful and did not do what his mother wanted. For this reason God was displeased with him and caused him to become ill, and no doctor could help him, and in a short time he lay on his deathbed.
He was lowered into a grave and covered with earth, but his little arm suddenly came forth and reached up, and it didn't help when they put it back in and put fresh earth over it, for the little arm always came out again. So the mother herself had to go to the grave and beat the little arm with a switch, and as soon as she had done that, it withdrew, and the child finally came to rest beneath the earth.
Next to a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and his two children. The boy's name was Hansel and the girl's name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great famine came to the land, he could no longer provide even their daily bread.
One evening as he was lying in bed worrying about his problems, he sighed and said to his wife, "What is to become of us? How can we feed our children when we have nothing for ourselves?"
"Man, do you know what?" answered the woman. "Early tomorrow morning we will take the two children out into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of them a little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them."
"No, woman," said the man. "I will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."
"Oh, you fool," she said, "then all four of us will starve. All you can do is to plane the boards for our coffins." And she gave him no peace until he agreed.
"But I do feel sorry for the poor children," said the man.
The two children had not been able to fall asleep because of their hunger, and they heard what the stepmother had said to the father.
Gretel cried bitter tears and said to Hansel, "It is over with us!"
"Be quiet, Gretel," said Hansel, "and don't worry. I know what to do."
And as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit.
Then he went back into the house and said, "Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us." Then he went back to bed.
At daybreak, even before sunrise, the woman came and woke the two children. "Get up, you lazybones. We are going into the woods to fetch wood." Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, "Here is something for midday. Don't eat it any sooner, for you'll not get any more."
Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones. Then all together they set forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel began stopping again and again and looking back toward the house.
The father said, "Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don't forget your legs."
"Oh, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye to me."
The woman said, "You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."
However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path.
When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, "You children gather some wood, and I will make a fire so you won't freeze."
Hansel and Gretel gathered together some twigs, a pile as high as a small mountain
The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, "Lie down by the fire and rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you."
Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of bread. Because they could hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch that he had tied to a dead tree and that the wind was beating back and forth. After they had sat there a long time, their eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep.
When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How will we get out of woods?"
Hansel comforted her, "Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."
After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house.
They knocked on the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, "You wicked children, why did you sleep so long in the woods? We thought that you did not want to come back."
But the father was overjoyed when he saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone.
Not long afterward there was once again great need everywhere, and one evening the children heard the mother say to the father, "We have again eaten up everything. We have only a half loaf of bread, and then the song will be over. We must get rid of the children. We will take them deeper into the woods, so they will not find their way out. Otherwise there will be no help for us."
The man was very disheartened, and he thought, "It would be better to share the last bit with the children."
But the woman would not listen to him, scolded him, and criticized him. He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well.
The children were still awake and had overheard the conversation. When the adults were asleep, Hansel got up again and wanted to gather pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. But he comforted his little sister and said, "Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us."
Early the next morning the woman came and got the children from their beds. They received their little pieces of bread, even less than the last time. On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground.
"Hansel, why are you always stopping and looking around?" said his father. "Keep walking straight ahead."
"I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me."
"Fool," said the woman, "that isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."
But little by little Hansel dropped all the crumbs onto the path. The woman took them deeper into the woods than they had ever been in their whole lifetime.
Once again a large fire was made, and the mother said, "Sit here, children. If you get tired you can sleep a little. We are going into the woods to cut wood. We will come and get you in the evening when we are finished."
When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel, who had scattered his piece along the path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed, but no one came to get the poor children.
It was dark at night when they awoke, and Hansel comforted Gretel and said, "Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."
When the moon appeared they got up, but they could not find any crumbs, for the many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up.
Hansel said to Gretel, "We will find our way," but they did not find it.
They walked through the entire night and the next day from morning until evening, but they did not find their way out of the woods. They were terribly hungry, for they had eaten only a few small berries that were growing on the ground. And because they were so tired that their legs would no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep. It was already the third morning since they had left the father's house. They started walking again, but managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods. If help did not come soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it stretched its wings and flew in front of them. They followed it until they came to a little house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar.
"Let's help ourselves to a good meal," said Hansel. "I'll eat a piece of the roof, and Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet."
Hansel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to see how it tasted, while Gretel stood next to the windowpanes and was nibbling at them. Then a gentle voice called out from inside:
Nibble, nibble, little mouse,
Who is nibbling at my house?
The children answered:
The wind, the wind,
The heavenly child.
They continued to eat, without being distracted. Hansel, who very much like the taste of the roof, tore down another large piece, and Gretel poked out an entire round windowpane. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman, as old as the hills and leaning on a crutch, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their hands.
But the old woman shook her head and said, "Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you."
She took them by the hand and led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal: milk and pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate.
Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching.
When Hansel and Gretel came near to her, she laughed wickedly and spoke scornfully, "Now I have them. They will not get away from me again."
Early the next morning, before they awoke, she got up, went to their beds, and looked at the two of them lying there so peacefully, with their full red cheeks. "They will be a good mouthful," she mumbled to herself. Then she grabbed Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked him behind a cage door. Cry as he might, there was no help for him.
Then she shook Gretel and cried, "Get up, lazybones! Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat him."
Gretel began to cry, but it was all for nothing. She had to do what the witch demanded. Now Hansel was given the best things to eat every day, but Gretel received nothing but crayfish shells.
Every morning the old woman crept out to the stall and shouted, "Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat yet."
But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel's finger, and she wondered why he didn't get fat.
When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. "Hey, Gretel!" she shouted to the girl, "Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him."
Oh, how the poor little sister sobbed as she was forced to carry the water, and how the tears streamed down her cheeks! "Dear God, please help us," she cried. "If only the wild animals had devoured us in the woods, then we would have died together."
"Save your slobbering," said the old woman. "It doesn't help you at all."
The next morning Gretel had to get up early, hang up the kettle with water, and make a fire.
"First we are going to bake," said the old woman. "I have already made a fire in the oven and kneaded the dough."
She pushed poor Gretel outside to the oven, from which fiery flames were leaping. "Climb in," said the witch, "and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet." And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, "I don't know how to do that. How can I get inside?"
"Stupid goose," said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in." And she crawled up stuck her head into the oven.
Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. Then she closed the iron door and secured it with a bar. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably. Gretel ran straight to Hansel, unlocked his stall, and cried, "Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead."
Then Hansel jumped out, like a bird from its cage when someone opens its door. How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other's necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones.
"These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, filling his pockets.
Gretel said, "I will take some home with me as well," and she filled her apron full.
"But now we must leave," said Hansel, "and get out of these witch-woods."
After walking a few hours they arrived at a large body of water. "We cannot get across," said Hansel. "I cannot see a walkway or a bridge."
"There are no boats here," answered Gretel, "but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across."
Then she called out:
Duckling, duckling,
Here stand Gretel and Hansel.
Neither a walkway nor a bridge,
Take us onto your white back.
The duckling came up to them, and Hansel climbed onto it, then asked his little sister to sit down next to him.
"No," answered Gretel. "That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time."
That is what the good animal did, and when they were safely on the other side, and had walked on a little while, the woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally they saw the father's house in the distance. They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around the father's neck.
The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died. Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets.
Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.
My tale is done,
A mouse has run.
And whoever catches it can make for himself from it a large, large fur cap.

Once upon a time there lived a woodcutter and his wife; they had seven children, all boys. The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven. People were astonished that the woodcutter had had so many children in such a short time, but his wife was very fond of children, and never had less than two at a time
They were very poor, and their seven children inconvenienced them greatly, because not one of them was able to earn his own way. They were especially concerned, because the youngest was very sickly. He scarcely ever spoke a word, which they considered to be a sign of stupidity, although it was in truth a mark of good sense. He was very little, and when born no bigger than one's thumb, for which reason they called him Little Thumb.
The poor child bore the blame of everything that went wrong in the house. Guilty or not, he was always held to be at fault. He was, notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together. And although he spoke little, he listened well.
There came a very bad year, and the famine was so great that these poor people decided to rid themselves of their children. One evening, when the children were all in bed and the woodcutter was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief, "You see plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I cannot see them starve to death before my face. I am resolved to lose them in the woods tomorrow, which may very easily be done; for, while they are busy in tying up the bundles of wood, we can leave them, without their noticing."
"Ah!" cried out his wife; "and can you yourself have the heart to take your children out along with you on purpose to abandon them?"
In vain her husband reminded her of their extreme poverty. She would not consent to it. Yes, she was poor, but she was their mother. However, after having considered what a grief it would be for her to see them perish with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed in tears.
Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as he lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he got up softly, and hid under his father's stool, in order to hear what they were saying without being seen. He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking about what he had to do. He got up early in the morning, and went to the riverside, where he filled his pockets with small white pebbles, and then returned home.
They all went out, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew. They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces distance. The woodcutter began his work, and the children gathered up the sticks into bundles. Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, slipped away from them without being seen, and returned home along a byway through the bushes.
When the children saw they had been left alone, they began to cry as loudly as they could. Little Thumb let them cry, knowing very well how to get home again, for he had dropped the little white pebbles all along the way. Then he said to them, "Don't be afraid, brothers. Father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again. Just follow me."
They did so, and he took them home by the very same way they had come into the forest. They dared not go in, but sat down at the door, listening to what their father and mother were saying.
The woodcutter and his wife had just arrived home, when the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and which they never expected. This gave them new life, for the poor people were almost famished. The woodcutter sent his wife immediately to the butcher's. As it had been a long while since they had eaten, she bought three times as much meat as would be needed for two people.
When they had eaten, the woman said, "Alas! Where are our poor children now? They would make a good feast of what we have left here; but it was you, William, who decided to abandon them. I told you that we would be sorry for it. What are they now doing in the forest? Alas, dear God, the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up. You are very inhuman to have abandoned your children in this way."
The woodcutter at last lost his patience, for she repeated it more than twenty times, that they would be sorry for it, and that she was right for having said so. He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. It was not that the woodcutter was less upset than his wife, but that she was nagging him. He, like many others, was of the opinion that wives should say the right thing, but that they should not do so too often.
She nearly drowned herself in tears, crying out, "Alas! Where are now my children, my poor children?"
She spoke this so very loud that the children, who were at the gate, began to cry out all together, "Here we are! Here we are!"
She immediately ran to open the door, and said, hugging them, "I am so glad to see you, my dear children; you are very hungry and tired. And my poor Peter, you are horribly dirty; come in and let me clean you."
Now, you must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above all the rest, because he had red hair, as she herself did.
They sat down to supper and ate with a good appetite, which pleased both father and mother. They told them how frightened they had been in the forest, speaking almost always all together. The parents were extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and decided to abandon them again. This time they resolved to take them much deeper into the forest than before.
Although they tried to talk secretly about it, again they were overheard by Little Thumb, who made plans to get out of this difficulty as well as he had the last time. However, even though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles, he could not do so, for he found the door securely bolted and locked. Their father gave each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast, and he fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles, by throwing it in little bits all along the way; and so he put it into his pocket.
Their father and mother took them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, then, slipping away by an obscure path, they left them there. Little Thumb was not concerned, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered along the way; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb. The birds had come and had eaten every bit of it up. They were now in great distress, for the farther they went the more lost and bewildered they became.
Night now came on, and there arose a terrible high wind, which made them dreadfully afraid. They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up. They scarcely dared to speak or turn their heads. After this, it rained very hard, which drenched them to the skin; their feet slipped at every step they took, and they fell into the mire, getting them muddy all over. Their hands were numb with cold.
Little Thumb climbed to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover anything. Turning his head in every direction, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way from the forest. He came down, but from the ground, he could no longer see it no more, which concerned him greatly. However, after walking for some time with his brothers in the direction where he had seen the light, he perceived it again as he came out of the woods.
They came at last to the house where this candle was, but not without many fearful moments, for every time they walked down into a hollow they lost sight of it. They knocked at the door, and a good woman opened it. She asked them what they wanted.
Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest, and begged her, for God's sake, to give them lodging.
The woman, seeing that they were good looking children, began to weep, and said to them, "Alas, poor babies, where are you from? Do you know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children?"
"Ah! dear madam," answered Little Thumb (who, as well as his brothers, was trembling all over), "what shall we do? If you refuse to let us sleep here then the wolves of the forest surely will devour us tonight. We would prefer the gentleman to eat us, but perhaps he would take pity upon us, especially if you would beg him to."
The ogre's wife, who believed she could hide them from her husband until morning, let them come in, and had them to warm themselves at a very good fire. There was a whole sheep on the spit, roasting for the ogre's supper.
After they warmed up a little, they heard three or four great raps at the door. This was the ogre, who was come home. Hearing him, she hid them under the bed and opened the door. The ogre immediately asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat down at the table. The sheep was still raw and bloody, but he preferred it that way. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying, "I smell fresh meat."
His wife said, "You can smell the calf which I have just now killed and flayed."
"I smell fresh meat, I tell you once more," replied the ogre, looking crossly at his wife, "and there is something here which I do not understand."
As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed. "Ah, hah!" he said. "I see then how you would cheat me, you cursed woman; I don't know why I don't eat you as well. It is fortunate for you that you are tough old carrion. But here is good game, which has luckily arrived just in time to serve to three ogre friends who are coming here to visit in a day or two."
With that he dragged them out from under the bed, one by one. The poor children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon; but they were dealing with one of the cruelest ogres in the world. Far from having any pity on them, he had already devoured them with his eyes. He told his wife that they would be delicate eating with good savory sauce. He then took a large knife, and, approaching the poor children, sharpened it on a large whetstone which he held in his left hand.
He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him, "Why do it now? Is it not tomorrow soon enough?"
"Hold your chatter," said the ogre; "they will be more tender, if I kill them now."
"But you have so much meat already," replied his wife. "You have no need for more. Here are a calf, two sheep, and half a hog."
"That is true," said the ogre. "Feed them so they don't get too thin, and put them to bed."
The good woman was overjoyed at this, and offered them a good supper, but they were so afraid that they could not eat a bit. As for the ogre, he sat down to drink, being highly pleased that now had something special to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary, which went to his head and made him sleepy.
The ogre had seven little daughters. These young ogresses all had very fine complexions, because they ate fresh meat like their father; but they had little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, and very long sharp teeth, well spaced from each other. As yet they were not overly mischievous, but they showed great promise for it, for they had already bitten little children in order to suck their blood.
They had been put to bed early, all seven in a large bed, and each of them wearing a crown of gold on her head. The ogre's wife gave the seven little boys a bed just as large and in the same room, then she went to bed to her husband.
Little Thumb, who had observed that the ogre's daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the ogre should change his mind about not killing them, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers' caps and his own, went very softly and put them on the heads of the seven little ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put on his own head and his brothers', that the ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill.
All of this happened according to his plan for, the ogre awakened about midnight and, regretting that he had put off until morning that which he might have done tonight, he hastily got out of bed and picked up his large knife. "Let us see," he said, "how our little rogues are doing! We'll not make that mistake a second time!"
He then went, groping all the way, into his daughters' room. He came to the bed where the little boys lay. They were all fast asleep except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he felt the ogre feeling about his head, as he had done about his brothers'. Feeling the golden crowns, the ogre said, "That would have been a terrible mistake. Truly, I did drink too much last night."
Then he went to the bed where the girls lay. Finding the boys' caps on them, he said, "Ah, hah, my merry lads, here you are. Let us get to work." So saying, and without further ado, he cut all seven of his daughters' throats. Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife.
As soon as Little Thumb heard the ogre snore, he wakened his brothers and told them to put on their clothes immediately and to follow him. They stole softly down into the garden, and climbed over the wall. They kept running nearly the whole night, trembling all the while, and not knowing which way they were going.
The ogre, when he awoke, said to his wife, "Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night."
The ogress was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming how he intended that she should dress them, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put their clothes on them, she went up, and was horribly astonished when she saw her seven daughters with their throats cut and lying in their own blood.
She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases. The ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle.
"What have I done?" he cried. "Those wretches shall soon pay for this!" He threw a pitcher of water on his wife's face, and, having brought her to herself, cried, "Bring me my seven-league boots at once, so that I can catch them."
He went out, and ran this way and that over a vast amount of ground. At last he came to the very road where the poor children were, and not more than a hundred paces from their father's house. They saw the ogre coming, who was stepping from mountain to mountain, and crossing over rivers as easily as if they were little streams. Little Thumb hid himself and his brothers in a nearby hollow rock, all the while keeping watch on the ogre.
The ogre was very tired from his long and fruitless journey (for seven-league boots are very tiring to wear), and decided to take a rest. By chance he sat on the rock where the little boys had hid themselves. He was so tired that he fell asleep, and began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he had held up his large knife and was about to cut their throats. However, Little Thumb was not as frightened as his brothers were, and told them that they immediately should run away towards home while the ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not worry about him. They took his advice, and soon reached home. Little Thumb came up to the ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own feet. The boots were very long and large, but because they were enchanted, they became big or little to fit the person who was wearing them. So they fit his feet and legs as well as if they had been custom made for him. He immediately went to the ogre's house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of her murdered daughters.
"Your husband," said Little Thumb, "is in very great danger. He has been captured by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver. At the very moment they were holding their daggers to his throat he saw me, and begged me to come and tell you the condition he is in. You should give me everything he has of value, without keeping back anything at all, for otherwise they will kill him without mercy. Because his case is so very urgent, he lent me his boots (you see I have them on), that I might make the more haste and to show you that he himself has sent me to you."
The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had, for although this ogre ate up little children, he was a good husband. Thus Little Thumb got all the ogre' s money. He returned with it to his father's house, where he was received with great joy.
There are many people who do not agree with this last detail. They claim that Little Thumb never robbed the ogre at all, that he only made off with the seven-league boots, and that with a good conscience, because the ogre's only use of them was to pursue little children. These folks affirm that they are quite sure of this, because they have often drunk and eaten at the woodcutter's house.
These people claim that after taking off the ogre's boots, Little Thumb went to court, where he learned that there was much concern about the outcome of a certain battle and the condition of a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off. They say that he went to the king, and told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night. The king promised him a great sum of money if he could do so. Little Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with the news. This first feat brought him great fame, and he could then name his own price. Not only did the king pay him very well for carrying his orders to the army, but the ladies of the court paid him handsomely to bring them information about their lovers. Occasionally wives gave him letters for their husbands, but they paid so poorly, that he did not even bother to keep track of the money he made in this branch of his business.
After serving as a messenger for some time and thus acquiring great wealth, he went home to his father, where he was received with inexpressible joy. He made the whole family very comfortable, bought positions for his father and brothers, all the while handsomely looking after himself as well

Once upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and they could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and left them in a wood.
They traveled and traveled and could never see a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the door, and a woman came to it, who said, "What do you want?"
They said, "Please let us in and give us something to eat."
The woman said, "I can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes home."
They begged hard. "Let us stop for a little while," said they, "and we will go away before he comes."
So she took them in, and set them down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just as they had begun to eat, a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said:
Fee, fie, fo, fum,
I smell the blood of some earthly one.
"Who have you there, wife?"
"Eh," said the wife, "it's three poor lassies cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won't touch, 'em, man."
He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all night.
Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in the same bed with the three strangers. The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own lassies' necks, he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure everyone was sleeping sound. Then she slipped out of bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the giant's lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies and the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down. And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his own lassies out of the bed on to the floor, and battered them until they were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed finely.
Molly thought it time she and her sisters were off and away, so she wakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be a king's house; so Molly went in, and told her story to the king.
He said, "Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant's sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry."
Molly said she would try. So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and crept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just as she got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the "Bridge of one hair"; and she got over, but he couldn't and he says, "Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never ye come again."
And she says: "Twice yet, carle," quoth she, "I'll come to Spain." So Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married to his son.
Well, the king he says, "Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow, I would marry your second sister to my second son."
And Molly said she would try. So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and hid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out and slipped her hand below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the "Bridge of one hair," and she got over, but he couldn't, and he said, "Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come again."
"Once yet, carle," quoth she, "I'll come to Spain." So Molly took the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the king's second son.
After that the king says to Molly, "Molly, you are a clever girl, but if you would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears on his finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself."
Molly said she would try. So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got hold of the giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the hand and he says, "Now I have caught you, Molly Whuppie; and, if I done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?"
Molly says, "I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside wi' you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and shears, and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you down, and bang you till you were dead."
"Well, Molly," says the giant, "I'll just do that to you.
So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.
Molly she sings out, "Oh, if ye saw what I see."
"Oh," says the giant's wife, "what do you see, Molly?"
But Molly never said a word but, "Oh, if ye saw what I see!"
The giants wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down and helped the giants wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole.
The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, "It's me, man"; but the dog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice.
But Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her and he ran after her; and he ran, and she ran, till they came to the "Bridge of one hair," and she got over, but he couldn't; and he said, "Woe worth you, Mollie Whuppie! never you come again."
"Never more, carle," quoth she, "will I come again to Spain."
So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again.

One cold winter's day a peasant set out on a journey which led him through the depths of a forest into which he had not hitherto been. The result was that he lost his way, and after wandering about for many hours in the hope of finding it again, he found himself, just as dusk was coming on, in a little clearing where he was overjoyed to see a small house with a cheerful light in the window.
"Here is a chance of supper and a bed," thought the peasant, and he made haste to go up to the cottage door.
Now this house in the clearing was not inhabited by men, but by some strange forest folk who were called satyrs. If you want to know what they were like, you must look at the pictures. Certainly the peasant had never seen anything like them before, although he had often heard of them, and when he nearly tumbled over the little satyr children who were playing in the snow outside the house door, he was the most surprised man in all those parts. It was too late to draw back however, so he went boldly up to the door and gave a loud knock.
"Come in!" cried a gruff voice, and the peasant accordingly went in and found himself facing the father of all the satyrs, who had a long beard and a pair of horns jutting from his forehead. The poor fellow's knees trembled underneath him for fright, especially when he saw all the other satyrs, the mother and the uncles and the aunts, glowering at him.
"Please forgive me for my intrusion," said he, "but I have lost my way in the woods, and I am half dead with hunger and cold. It would be an act of great kindness if you would give me some food and allow me to take shelter for the night." So saying, to give point to his remarks, he set to work to blow upon his chilled fingers, which indeed were blue with the cold.
"Why are you blowing your fingers?" asked the father of all the satyrs curiously.
"Why, to warm them," answered the peasant, and he blew harder than before.
"Well, sit down," said the satyr. "As it happens we are just about to have supper, and you are welcome to share it with us."
So the peasant sat down to supper, and all the satyr family sat down too, and watched him with big unblinking eyes, so that he felt very uncomfortable. A big basin of soup was set before him, and finding it very hot, he began to blow upon it.
At this all the satyr family cried out in surprise, and the father satyr said, " Why are you blowing your soup?"
"To cool it," answered the peasant. "It is too hot, and I am afraid it may scald my mouth."
Another and a louder cry of surprise came from all the satyrs, but the father cried out loudest of all, and seemed very indignant. "Come," he said, advancing to the peasant and taking him by the collar. "Out you go! There is no place in my house for a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath. That smells too much of sorcery or magic. Out you go, I say, and practise your spells in the forest."
So the poor peasant had to go supperless and spend the night in the woods, with no shelter but the trees, and the snow for coverlet.
And, if you wish to know when all this happened, all I can tell you is that it was a very long time ago, in the days when fishes flew, and cats had wings.

Once upon a time there was a man who was so bad tempered and cross that he never thought his wife did anything right in the house. One evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and making a commotion.
"Dear love, don't be so angry. That's a good man," said his wife, "tomorrow let's change jobs. I'll go out with the mowers and mow, and you can mind the house at home."
Yes, the husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said.
So early the next morning, his wife took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hay field with the mowers and began to mow. But the man was to mind the house and do the work at home.
First of all he wanted to churn the butter. But when he had churned a while, he got thirsty and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. He had just knocked in the bung and was putting in the tap, when he heard the pig come into the kitchen above. As fast as he could, he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, to keep the pig from upsetting the churn. But when he got there he saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over, and was standing there routing and grunting in the cream which was running all over the floor. He got so angry that he quite forgot the ale barrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a powerful kick that he killed it on the spot.
Then he remembered he had the tap in his hand. But when he returned to the cellar, all the ale had run out of the barrel. Then he went into the milk-shed and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for they had to have butter for dinner.
When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milk cow was still shut up in the barn and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all morning, although the sun was high. It occurred to him that it was too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just get her up onto the roof, for it was a sod roof, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. The house was close against a steep hill, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the back of the roof he'd easily get the cow up.
But he couldn't leave the churn, for his little baby was crawling about on the floor. "If I leave it," he thought, "the child will tip it over." So he put the churn on his back, and went out with it. But then he thought he'd better first water the cow before he put her onto the roof, so he picked up a bucket to draw water out of the well. But as he stooped over the edge of the well all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulder and down into the well.
Now it was nearly dinner time, and he hadn't even finished the butter yet, so he thought he'd best boil the porridge. He filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, it occurred to him that the cow might fall off the roof and break her legs or her neck, so he climbed up onto the house to tie her up. He tied one end of the rope around the cow's neck. He slipped the other end down the chimney and tied it around his own leg. Then he had to hurry, for the water was now boiling in the pot, and he still had to grind the oatmeal.
He began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, the cow fell off the roof, dragging the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast. As for the cow, she hung halfway down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up.
Now the wife waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her husband to come and call her home to dinner, but he never came. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and she went home. But when she arrived home and saw the cow hanging there, she ran up and cut the rope with her scythe. When she did this, her husband fell down from within the chimney. When the old woman came inside, she found him with his head in the porridge pot.

There was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-White. And all they had to live on was the milk the cow gave every morning, which they carried to the market and sold. But one morning Milky-White gave no milk, and they didn't know what to do.
"What shall we do, what shall we do?" said the widow, wringing her hands.
"Cheer up, mother, I'll go and get work somewhere," said Jack.
"We've tried that before, and nobody would take you," said his mother. "We must sell Milky-White and with the money start a shop, or something."
"All right, mother," says Jack. "It's market day today, and I'll soon sell Milky-White, and then we'll see what we can do."
So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he started. He hadn't gone far when he met a funny-looking old man, who said to him, "Good morning, Jack."
"Good morning to you," said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name.
"Well, Jack, and where are you off to?" said the man.
"I'm going to market to sell our cow there."
"Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows," said the man. "I wonder if you know how many beans make five."
"Two in each hand and one in your mouth," says Jack, as sharp as a needle.
"Right you are," says the man, "and here they are, the very beans themselves," he went on, pulling out of his pocket a number of strange-looking beans. "As you are so sharp," says he, "I don't mind doing a swap with you -- your cow for these beans."
"Go along," says Jack. "Wouldn't you like it?"
"Ah! You don't know what these beans are," said the man. "If you plant them overnight, by morning they grow right up to the sky."
"Really?" said Jack. "You don't say so."
"Yes, that is so. And if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have your cow back."
"Right," says Jack, and hands him over Milky-White's halter and pockets the beans.
Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by the time he got to his door.
"Back already, Jack?" said his mother. "I see you haven't got Milky-White, so you've sold her. How much did you get for her?"
"You'll never guess, mother," says Jack.
"No, you don't say so. Good boy! Five pounds? Ten? Fifteen? No, it can't be twenty."
"I told you you couldn't guess. What do you say to these beans? They're magical. Plant them overnight and -- "
"What!" says Jack's mother. "Have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-White, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans? Take that! Take that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night."
So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake as for the loss of his supper.
At last he dropped off to sleep.
When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was shining into part of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady. So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you think he saw? Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all.
The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to do was to open it and give a jump onto the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder. So Jack climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till at last he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart. So he walked along, and he walked along, and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.
"Good morning, mum," says Jack, quite polite-like. "Could you be so kind as to give me some breakfast?" For he hadn't had anything to eat, you know, the night before, and was as hungry as a hunter.
"It's breakfast you want, is it?" says the great big tall woman. "It's breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here. My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast. You'd better be moving on or he'll be coming."
"Oh! please, mum, do give me something to eat, mum. I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum," says Jack. "I may as well be broiled as die of hunger."
Well, the ogre's wife was not half so bad after all. So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a hunk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk. But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump! thump! thump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming.
"Goodness gracious me! It's my old man," said the ogre's wife. "What on earth shall I do? Come along quick and jump in here." And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.
He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he had three calves strung up by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said, "Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah! what's this I smell?
Fee-fi-fo-fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman,
Be he alive, or be he dead,
I'll have his bones to grind my bread."
"Nonsense, dear," said his wife. "You' re dreaming. Or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner. Here, you go and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you come back your breakfast'll be ready for you."
So off the ogre went, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven and run away when the woman told him not. "Wait till he's asleep," says she; "he always has a doze after breakfast."
Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out a couple of bags of gold, and down he sits and counts till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole house shook again.
Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre, he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold, which, of course, fell into his mother's garden, and then he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said, "Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans? They are really magical, you see."
So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to the end of it, and Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he rose up early, and got onto the beanstalk, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till at last he came out onto the road again and up to the great tall house he had been to before. There, sure enough, was the great tall woman a-standing on the doorstep.
"Good morning, mum," says Jack, as bold as brass, "could you be so good as to give me something to eat?"
"Go away, my boy," said the big tall woman, "or else my man will eat you up for breakfast. But aren't you the youngster who came here once before? Do you know, that very day my man missed one of his bags of gold."
"That's strange, mum," said Jack, "I dare say I could tell you something about that, but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat."
Well, the big tall woman was so curious that she took him in and gave him something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he could when thump! thump! they heard the giant's footstep, and his wife hid Jack away in the oven.
All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before, said, "Fee-fi-fo-fum," and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen.
Then he said, "Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs." So she brought it, and the ogre said, "Lay," and it laid an egg all of gold. And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook.
Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say "Jack Robinson." But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he heard him calling, "Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?"
And the wife said, "Why, my dear?"
But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire. And when he got home he showed his mother the wonderful hen, and said "Lay" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said "Lay."
Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he rose up early and got to the beanstalk, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till he got to the top.
But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house. And when he got near it, he waited behind a bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper. He hadn't been there long when he heard thump! thump! thump! as before, and in came the ogre and his wife.
"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman," cried out the ogre. "I smell him, wife, I smell him."
"Do you, my dearie?" says the ogre's wife. "Then, if it's that little rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's sure to have got into the oven." And they both rushed to the oven.
But Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre' s wife said, "There you are again with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why, of course, it's the boy you caught last night that I've just broiled for your breakfast. How forgetful I am, and how careless you are not to know the difference between live and dead after all these years."
So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and then he would mutter, "Well, I could have sworn --" and he'd get up and search the larder and the cupboards and everything, only, luckily, he didn't think of the copper.
After breakfast was over, the ogre called out, "Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp."
So she brought it and put it on the table before him. Then he said, "Sing!" and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
Then Jack lifted up the copper lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door.
But the harp called out quite loud, "Master! Master!" and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.
Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him, only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear like, and when he came to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start.
But just then the harp cried out, "Master! Master!" and the ogre swung himself down onto the beanstalk, which shook with his weight. Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre.
By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home. So he called out, "Mother! Mother! bring me an ax, bring me an ax." And his mother came rushing out with the ax in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright, for there she saw the ogre with his legs just through the clouds.
But Jack jumped down and got hold of the ax and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two. The ogre felt the beanstalk shake and quiver, so he stopped to see what was the matter. Then Jack gave another chop with the ax, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after.
Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his mother became very rich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after.

There lived a poor widow, whose cottage stood in a country village a long distance from London, for many years.
The widow had only a child named Jack, whom she gratified in everything. The consequence of her partiality was that Jack paid little attention to anything she said, and he was heedless and extravagant. His follies were not owing to bad disposition but to his mother never having chided him. As she was not wealthy, and he would not work, she was obliged to support herself and him by selling everything she had. At last nothing remained, only a cow.
The widow, with tears in her eyes, could not help reproaching Jack. "Oh! You wicked boy," said she. "By your prodigal course of life you have now brought us both to fall! Heedless, heedless boy! I have not money enough to buy a bit of bread for another day. Nothing remains but my poor cow, and that must be sold, or we must starve!"
Jack was in a degree of tenderness for a few minutes, but soon over. And then becoming very hungry for want of food, he teased his poor mother to let him sell the cow, to which at last she reluctantly consented.
As he proceeded on his journey he met a butcher, who inquired why he was driving the cow from home. Jack replied he was going to sell it. The butcher had some wonderful beans of different colors in his bag which attracted Jack's notice. This the butcher saw, who, knowing Jack's easy temper, resolved to take advantage of it, and offered all the beans for the cow. The foolish boy thought it a great offer. The bargain was momently struck, and the cow exchanged for a few paltry beans. When Jack hastened home with the beans and told his mother, and showed them to her, she kicked the beans away in a great passion. They flew in all directions, and were extended as far as the garden.
Early in the morning Jack arose from his bed, and seeing something strange from the window, he hastened downstairs into the garden, where he soon found that some of the beans had grown in root and sprung up wonderfully. The stalks grew in an immense thickness and had so entwined that they formed a ladder like a chain in view.
Looking upwards, he could not descry the top. It seemed to be lost in the clouds. He tried it, discovered it firm and not to be shaken. A new idea immediately struck him. He would climb the beanstalk and see to whence it would lead. Full of this plan, which made him forget even his hunger, Jack hastened to communicate his intention to his mother.
He instantly set out, and after climbing for some hours reached the top of the beanstalk, fatigued and almost exhausted. Looking round, he was surprised to find himself in a strange country. It looked to be quite a barren desert. Not a tree, shrub, house, or living creature was to be seen.
Jack sat himself pensively upon a block of stone and thought of his mother. His hunger attacked him, and now he appeared sorrowful for his disobedience in climbing the beanstalk against her will, and concluded that he must now die for want of food.
However, he walked on, hoping to see a house where he might beg something to eat. Suddenly he observed a beautiful young female at some distance. She was dressed in an elegant manner, and had a small white wand in her hand, on the top of which was a peacock of pure gold.
She approached and said, "I will reveal to you a story your mother dare not. But before I begin, I require a solemn promise on your part to do what I command. I am a fairy, and unless you perform exactly what I direct you to do, you will deprive me of the power to assist you, and there is little doubt but that you will die in the attempt."
Jack was rather frightened at this caution, but promised to follow her directions.

Your father was a rich man, with a disposition greatly benevolent. It was his practice never to refuse relief to the deserving in his neighborhood, but, on the contrary, to seek out the helpless and distressed.
Not many miles from your father's house lived a huge giant who was the dread of the country around for cruelty and oppression. This creature was moreover of a very envious disposition, and disliked to hear others talked of for their goodness and humanity, and he vowed to do him a mischief, so that he might no longer hear his good actions made the subject of everyone's conversation.
Your father was too good a man to fear evil from others. Consequently it was not long before the cruel giant found an opportunity to put his wicked threats into practice, for hearing that your parents were passing a few days with a friend at some distance from home, he caused your father to be waylaid and murdered, and your mother to be seized on their way homeward.
At the time this happened you were but a few months old. Your poor mother, almost dead with affright and horror, was borne away by the cruel giant's emissaries to a dungeon under his house, in which she and her poor babe were both long confined as prisoners. Distracted at the absence of your parents, the servants went in search of them, but no tidings of either could be obtained. Meantime he caused a will to be found making over all your father's property to him as your guardian, and as such he took open possession.
After your mother had been some months in prison the giant offered to restore her to liberty, on condition that she would solemnly swear that she would never divulge the story of her wrongs to anyone. To put it out of her power to do him any harm, should she break her oath, the giant had her put on shipboard and taken to a distant country, where he had her left with no more money for her support than what she obtained from the sale of a few jewels she had secreted in her dress.
I was appointed your father's guardian at his birth, but fairies have laws to which they are subject as well as mortals. A short time before the giant assassinated your father I transgressed. My punishment was a suspension of my power for a limited time, an unfortunate circumstance, as it entirely prevented my assisting your father, even when I most wished to do so.
The day on which you met the butcher, as you went to sell your mother's cow, my power was restored. It was I who secretly prompted you to take the beans in exchange for the cow. By my power the beanstalk grew to so great a height and formed a ladder. The giant lives in this country. You are the person appointed to punish him for all his wickedness. You will have dangers and difficulties to encounter, but you must persevere in avenging the death of your father, or you will not prosper in any of your undertakings.
As to the giant's possessions, everything he has is yours, though you are deprived of it. You may take, therefore, what part of it you can. You must, however, be careful, for such is his love for gold that the first loss he discovers will make him outrageous and very watchful for the future. But you must still pursue him, for it is only by stratagem that you can ever hope to overcome him and become possessed of your rightful property, and the means of retributive justice overtaking him for his barbarous murder.
One thing I desire is, do not let your mother know you are acquainted with your father's history till you see me again. Go along the direct road. You will soon see the house where your cruel enemy lives. While you do as I order you I will protect and guard you. But remember, if you disobey my commands, a dreadful punishment awaits you."
As soon as she had concluded she disappeared, leaving Jack to follow his journey. He walked on till after sunset, when to his great joy he espied a large mansion. This pleasant sight revived his drooping spirits. He redoubled his speed and reached it shortly. A well-looking woman stood at the door. He accosted her, begging she would give him a morsel of bread and a night's lodging. She expressed the greatest surprise at seeing him and said it was quite uncommon to see any strange creature near their house, for it was mostly known that her husband was a very cruel and powerful giant, and one that would eat human flesh if he could possibly get it.

This account terrified Jack greatly, but still, not forgetting the fairy's protection, he hoped to elude the giant, and therefore he entreated the woman to take him in for one night only and hide him where she thought proper. The good woman at last suffered herself to be persuaded, for her disposition was remarkably compassionate, and at last led him into the house.
First they passed an elegant hall, finely furnished. They then proceeded through several spacious rooms, all in the same style of grandeur, but they looked to be quite forsaken and desolate. A long gallery came next. It was very dark, just large enough to show that instead of a wall on each side there was a grating of iron, which parted off a dismal dungeon, for whence issued the groans of several poor victims whom the cruel giant reserved in confinement for his voracious appetite. Poor Jack was in a dreadful fright at witnessing such a horrible scene, which caused him to fear that he would never see his mother, but be captured lastly for the giant's meat. But still he recollected the fairy, and a gleam of hope forced itself into his heart.
The good woman then took Jack to a spacious kitchen, where a great fire was kept. She bade him sit down and gave him plenty to eat and drink. In the meantime he had done his meal and enjoyed himself, but was disturbed by a hard knocking at the gate, so loud as to cause the house to shake. Jack was concealed in the oven, and the giant's wife ran to let in her husband.
Jack heard him accost her in a voice like thunder, saying, "Wife! Wife! I smell fresh meat!"
"Oh! My dear," replied she, "it is nothing but the people in the dungeon."
The giant seemed to believe her, and at last seated himself by the fireside, whilst the wife prepared supper.
By degrees Jack endeavored to look at the monster through a small crevice. He was much surprised to see what an amazing quantity he devoured, and supposed he would never have done eating and drinking.
After his supper was ended a very curious hen was brought and placed on the table before him. Jack's curiosity was so great to see what would happen. He observed that it stood quiet before him, and every time the giant said, "Lay!" the hen laid an egg of solid gold. The giant amused himself a long time with his hen.
Meanwhile his wife went to bed At length he fell asleep and snored like the roaring of a cannon. Jack, finding him still asleep at daybreak, crept softly from his hiding place, seized the hen, and ran off with her as fast as his legs could possibly allow him.
Jack easily retraced his way to the beanstalk and descended it better quicker than he expected. His mother was overjoyed to see him.
"Now, mother," said Jack, "I have brought you home that which will make you rich."
The hen produced as many golden eggs as they desired. They sold them and soon became possessed of as much riches as they wanted.
For a few months Jack and his mother lived very happy, but he longed to pay the giant another visit. Early in the morning he again climbed the beanstalk and reached the giant's mansion late in the evening.
The woman was at the door as before. Jack told her a pitiful tale and prayed for a night's shelter. She told him that she had admitted a poor hungry boy once before, and the little ingrate had stolen one of the giant's treasures, and ever since that she had been cruelly used. She, however, led him to the kitchen, gave him supper, and put him in a lumber closet.
Soon after, the giant came in, took his supper, and ordered his wife to bring down his bags of gold and silver. Jack peeped out of his hiding place and observed the giant counting over his treasures, and after which he carefully put them in bags again, fell asleep, and snored as before.
Jack crept quietly from his hiding place and approached the giant, when a little dog under the chair barked furiously. Contrary to his expectation, the giant slept on soundly, and the dog ceased. Jack seized the bags, reached the door in safety, and soon arrived at the bottom of the beanstalk.
When he reached his mother's cottage he found it quite deserted. Greatly surprised, he ran into the village, and an old woman directed him to a house, where he found his mother apparently dying. On being informed of our hero's safe return, his mother revived and soon recovered. Jack then presented two bags of gold and silver to her.
Her mother discovered that something preyed upon his mind heavily and endeavored to discover the cause, but Jack knew too well what the consequence would be should he discover the cause of his melancholy to her. He did his utmost therefore to conquer the great desire which now forced itself upon him in spite of himself for another journey up the beanstalk.
On the longest day Jack arose as soon as it was light, ascended the beanstalk and reached the top with some little trouble. He found the road, journey, etc., the same as on the former occasions. He arrived at the giant's house in the evening and found his wife standing as usual at the door.
Jack now appeared a different character, and had disguised himself so completely that she did not appear to have any recollection of him. However, when he begged admittance, he found it very difficult to persuade her. At last he prevailed, was allowed to go in, and was concealed in the copper.
When the giant returned, he said, as usual, "Wife! Wife! I smell fresh meat!"
But Jack felt quite composed, as he had said so before, and had soon been satisfied. However, the giant started up suddenly, and notwithstanding all his wife could say, he searched all round the room. Whilst this was going forward, Jack was much terrified, and ready to die with fear, wishing himself at home a thousand times. But when the giant approached the copper and put his hand upon the lid, Jack thought his death was certain. Fortunately the giant ended his search there without moving the lid, and seated himself quietly by the fireside.
When the giant's supper was over he commanded his wife to fetch down his harp. Jack peeped under the copper lid, and soon saw the most beautiful one that could be imagined. It was put by the giant on the table, who said, "Play," and it instantly played of its own accord. The music was uncommonly fine. Jack was delighted and felt more anxious to get the harp into his possession than either of the former treasures.
The giant's soul was not attuned to harmony, and the music soon lulled him into a sound sleep. Now, therefore, was the time to carry off the harp, as the giant appeared to be in a more profound sleep than usual. Jack soon made up his mind, got out of the copper, and seized the harp, which, however, being enchanted by a fairy, called out loudly, "Master, master!"
The giant awoke, stood up, and tried to pursue Jack, but he had drank so much that he could not stand. Jack ran as quick as he could. In a little time the giant recovered sufficiently to walk slowly, or rather to reel after him. Had he been sober, he must have overtaken Jack instantly. But as he then was, Jack contrived to be first at the top of the beanstalk. The giant called to him all the way along the road in a voice like thunder, and was sometimes very near to him.
The moment Jack down the beanstalk he called out for a hatchet. One was brought him directly. Just at that instant the giant began to descend, but Jack with his hatchet cut the beanstalk close off at the root, and the giant fell headlong into the garden. The fall instantly killed him.
Jack heartily begged his mother's pardon for all the sorrow and affliction he had caused her, promising most faithfully to be dutiful and obedient to her in future. He proved as good as his word and became a pattern of affectionate behavior and attention to his parent.

Once upon a time there was a peasant who had money and land enough, but as rich as he was, there was still something missing from his happiness: He had no children with his wife. Often when he went to the city with the other peasants, they would mock him and ask him why he had no children. He finally became angry, and when he returned home, he said, "I will have a child, even if it is a hedgehog."
Then his wife had a baby, and the top half was a hedgehog and the bottom half a boy. When she saw the baby, she was horrified and said, "Now see what you have wished upon us!"
The man said, "It cannot be helped. The boy must be baptized, but we cannot ask anyone to be his godfather."
The woman said, "And the only name that we can give him is Hans-My-Hedgehog."
When he was baptized, the pastor said, "Because of his quills he cannot be given an ordinary bed." So they put a little straw behind the stove and laid him in it. And he could not drink from his mother, for he would have stuck her with his quills. He lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father grew tired of him, and thought, "if only he would die." But he did not die, but just lay there.
Now it happened that there was a fair in the city, and the peasant wanted to go. He asked his wife what he should bring her.
"A little meat, some bread rolls, and things for the household," she said. Then he asked the servant girl, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some fancy stockings.
Finally, he also said, "Hans-My-Hedgehog, what would you like?"
"Father," he said, "bring me some bagpipes."
When the peasant returned home he gave his wife what he had brought for her, meat and bread rolls. Then he gave the servant girl the slippers and fancy stockings. And finally he went behind the stove and gave Hans-My-Hedgehog the bagpipes.
When Hans-My-Hedgehog had them, he said, "Father, go to the blacksmith's and have my cock-rooster shod, then I will ride away and never again come back." The father was happy to get rid of him, so he had his rooster shod, and when it was done, Hans-My-Hedgehog climbed on it and rode away. He took pigs and donkeys with him, to tend in the forest.
In the forest the rooster flew into a tall tree with him. There he sat and watched over the donkeys and the pigs. He sat there for years, until finally the herd had grown large. His father knew nothing about him. While sitting in the tree, he played his bagpipes and made beautiful music.
One day a king came by. He was lost and heard the music. He was amazed to hear it, and sent a servant to look around and see where it was coming from. He looked here and there but only saw a little animal sitting high in a tree. It looked like a rooster up there with a hedgehog sitting on it making the music.
The king said to the servant that he should ask him why he was sitting there, and if he knew the way back to his kingdom. Then Hans-My-Hedgehog climbed down from the tree and told him that he would show him the way if the king would promise in writing to give him the first thing that greeted him at the royal court upon his arrival home.
The king thought, "I can do that easily enough. Hans-My-Hedgehog cannot understand writing, and I can put down what I want to."
Then the king took pen and ink and wrote something, and after he had done so, Hans-My-Hedgehog showed him the way, and he arrived safely at home. His daughter saw him coming from afar, and was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him and kissed him. He thought about Hans-My-Hedgehog and told her what had happened, that he was supposed to have promised the first thing that greeted him to a strange animal that rode a rooster and made beautiful music. But instead he had written that this would not happen, for Hans-My-Hedgehog could not read. The princess was happy about this, and said that it was a good thing, for she would not have gone with him in any event.
Hans-My-Hedgehog tended the donkeys and pigs, was of good cheer, and sat in the tree blowing on his bagpipes.
Now it happened that another king came this way with his servants and messengers. He too got lost and did not know the way back home because the forest was so large. He too heard the beautiful music from afar, and asked one of his messengers to go and see what it was and where it was coming from. The messenger ran to the tree where he saw Hans-My-Hedgehog astride the cock-rooster. The messenger asked him what he was doing up there.
"I am tending my donkeys and pigs. What is it that you want?" replied Hans-My-Hedgehog.
The messenger said that they were lost and could not find their way back to their kingdom, and asked him if he could not show them the way.
Then Hans-My-Hedgehog climbed down from the tree with his rooster and told the old king that he would show him the way if he would give him the thing that he first met at home before the royal castle.
The king said yes and signed a promise to Hans-My-Hedgehog.
When that was done, Hans-My-Hedgehog rode ahead on his rooster showing them the way, and the king safely reached his kingdom. When the king arrived at his court there was great joy. Now he had an only daughter who was very beautiful. She ran out to him, threw her arms around his neck and kissed him, and was ever so happy that her old father had returned.
She asked him where he had been during his long absence, and he told her how he had lost his way and almost not made it home again, but that as he was making his way through a great forest he had come upon a half hedgehog, half human astride a rooster sitting in a tall tree and making beautiful music who had shown him the way, but whom he had promised whatever first met him at the royal court, and it was she herself, and he was terribly sorry.
But she promised that she would go with him when he came, for the love of her old father.
Hans-My-Hedgehog tended his pigs, and the pigs had more pigs, until there were so many that the whole forest was full. Then Hans-My-Hedgehog let his father know that they should empty out all the stalls in the village, because he was coming with such a large herd of pigs that everyone who wanted to would be able to take part in the slaughter.
It saddened the father to hear this, for he thought that Hans-My-Hedgehog had long since died. But Hans-My-Hedgehog mounted his cock-rooster, drove the pigs ahead of himself into the village, and had them butchered. What a slaughter! What a commotion! They could hear the noise two hours away!
Afterward Hans-My-Hedgehog said, "Father, have my cock-rooster shod a second time at the blacksmith's. Then I will ride away and not come back again as long as I live." So the father had the cock-rooster shod, and was happy that Hans-My-Hedgehog was not coming back.
Hans-My-Hedgehog rode into the first kingdom. The king had ordered that if anyone should approach who was carrying bagpipes and riding on a rooster, that he should be shot at, struck down, and stabbed, to prevent him from entering the castle. Thus when Hans-My-Hedgehog rode up, they attacked him with bayonets, but he spurred his rooster on, flew over the gate and up to the king's window. Landing there, he shouted to him, to give him what he had promised, or it would cost him and his daughter their lives.
Then the king told the princess to go out to him, in order to save his life and her own as well. She put on a white dress, and her father gave her a carriage with six horses, magnificent servants, money, and property. She climbed aboard and Hans-My-Hedgehog took his place beside her with his rooster and bagpipes. They said farewell and drove off.
The king thought that he would never see them again. However, it did not go as he thought it would, for when they had traveled a short distance from the city, Hans-My-Hedgehog pulled off her beautiful clothes and stuck her with his quills until she was bloody all over. "This is the reward for your deceit. Go away. I do not want you." With that he sent her back home, and she was cursed as long as she lived.
Hans-My-Hedgehog, astride his cock-rooster and carrying his bagpipes, rode on to the second kingdom where he had also helped the king find his way. This one, in contrast, had ordered that if anyone looking like Hans-My-Hedgehog should arrive, he should be saluted and brought to the royal castle with honors and with a military escort.
When the princess saw him she was horrified, because he looked so strange, but she thought that nothing could be done about it, because she had promised her father to go with him. She welcomed Hans-My-Hedgehog, and they were married. Then he was taken to the royal table, and she sat next to him while they ate and drank.
That evening when it was time to go to bed, she was afraid of his quills, but he told her to have no fear, for he would not hurt her. He told the old king to have four men keep watch by their bedroom door. They should make a large fire. He said that he would take off his hedgehog skin after going into the bedroom, and before getting into bed. The men should immediately pick it up and throw it into the fire, and then stay there until it was completely consumed by the fire.
When the clock struck eleven, he went into the bedroom, took off the hedgehog skin, and laid it down by the bed. The men rushed in, grabbed it, and threw it into the fire, and as soon as the fire consumed it, he was redeemed, and he lay there in bed entirely in the shape of a human. But he was as black as coal, as though he had been charred. The king sent for his physician, who washed him with good salves and balms. Then he became white and was a handsome young gentleman.
When the princess saw what had happened, she was overjoyed, and they got up and ate and drank. Now their wedding was celebrated for real, and Hans-My-Hedgehog inherited the old king's kingdom.
Some years later he traveled with his wife to his father, and said that he was his son. But the father said that he did not have a son. He had had one, but he had been born with quills like a hedgehog and had gone off into the world. Then he said that he was the one, and the old father rejoiced and returned with him to his kingdom.
My tale is done,
And has gone
To Gustchen's home.

Once upon a time there was a king. His wife bore him only one son, and he had not much pleasure with him, for a wicked witch had transformed him into a wild pig. The king and queen were very sad about this, but because things that have happened cannot be changed, they finally came to terms with the situation. They allowed the wild pig to run about the courtyard and the palace garden, where he behaved himself very well and did no one any harm.
Not far from the king's castle there was another castle where a rich lord lived who had three daughters, each one more beautiful than the others. One day the wild pig ran off further than usual and saw the oldest daughter as she was picking flowers in a field. She pleased him so much that he fell head over heels in love with her, and with all his might he wanted to marry her.
The king tried to convince him, that this would not be possible, but to no avail. The wild pig would hear none of this, saying further that if she would not become his wife then he would die of grief. So the king sent someone to the lord of the castle and informed him how things stood. At first the lord was not very pleased with the proposal, but after considering that the prince would otherwise die, he gave his consent. However, the daughter did not approve and said -- to the contrary -- that she would rather do God-knows-what than to have a disgusting pig for a husband. But that did not help her, and over her objections, the king forced her to accept, and the wedding was celebrated with the greatest pomp in the world.
When it got late, and everyone was going to bed, the bride too lay herself down to sleep. The wild pig wanted to lie next to her, but when he jumped into bed, he unfortunately struck her on the neck with his heavy feet, and -- she was dead. No pen can describe how sad were the wild pig and the king and the parents of the bride.
One year later the wild pig ran astray once again and found the rich lord's second daughter in the field. She pleased him so much that he wanted to marry her, whatever it might cost. The king made many excuses, but it was like throwing oil into the fire, and in the end there was nothing left to do but to talk with the lord about it. He did not want to hear anything about it, and he opposed the marriage with all his power, saying that he had not raised his daughters for pigs and the like.
The king reported this to his son, who insisted even more fervently than before. Thus the king had to force the parents to marry off their daughter. With tears and crying the bride was taken from her castle and dragged to the wedding. It was a sad affair, as though each of the guests could foresee that the second bride would fare no better than had the first one. And that is exactly what happened, because when the bridegroom wanted to jump into bed, he hit her on the neck with his plump feet, and -- she was dead.
The sorrow cannot be described that ruled in the king's castle as well as in the other castle. The wild pig was beside himself because of what had happened, and he struck his head against the walls as if he were tired of living. The bride's parents could not be consoled. Of three daughters, they now had only one, who was still a tender young girl, and they were afraid of losing her as they had the others. Thus they wanted to pack their belongings and move to a foreign country. When the king heard this, he became even sadder than before, and even angrier with his son. He asked the rich lord to remain in his castle and promised him that he would drive away the wild pig immediately.
And he kept this promise. The poor prince was driven out of the castle without pity or compassion, and he ran into a nearby forest.
The rich lord's third daughter was a beautiful girl, and because she was as good as an angel, her parents no longer thought about the terrible way they had lost their other daughters.
One day everyone left castle to go walking in the woods. The girl liked the beautiful wildflowers so much that she could not pick enough of them, and the birds sang so beautifully that she could not hear them enough. She picked and picked, and listened and listened. Thus she fell further behind the others until she was finally all by herself. While she sat there picking flowers, a wild pig suddenly ran up to her, took her on his back, and ran away with her.
Her father and mother called and called, and the other people looked everywhere, but the girl could not be found, and that evening they had to return to the castle without the poor girl.
The wild pig did not eat her up, but instead carried her a long way off to a deep cave, where no person would dare to enter. He set the girl down quietly and gently and made a bed for her from soft moss. He ran back into the woods and returned with flowers and strawberries. In short, he did everything he could to please the girl, as far as he could tell from her eyes.
Now I don't have to tell you that the wild pig was none other than the enchanted prince. The girl felt more and more at ease, and finally she began to stroke the wild pig's coarse bristly head with her hands. He licked her hands and was so happy that tears ran from his eyes.
"Why are you crying?" asked the girl.
"Why should I not cry?" said the wild pig. "You could redeem me, but I know that you will not do so."
This saddened the girl, and she herself began to cry, saying, "Oh yes, I want to redeem you, wild pig, just tell me what I have to do."
The pig answered, "And what if I tell you, and you still don't do it? But I will tell you: You must take me as your husband, and marry me, and be my wife."
With that the girl laughed and jumped up and said, "If that is all I have to do, then I will redeem you."
When the wild pig heard this he jumped up three times with joy. Then he ran off and brought back enough soft green moss to make a bed in which they could comfortably sleep together.
That night the girl had an unusual dream. She thought that someone told her to get up early the next morning and take the large pelt that she would find next to the bed. Then she should leave the cave, close it off with a stone, and on this stone burn the pelt to ashes. This seemed very strange to her.
At the day's first dawning she looked out of the bed and did indeed see a large pelt, like one from a wild pig, lying there. The girl took courage, went to the cave's entrance, and with all the power she could muster rolled a heavy stone that lay nearby to the entrance. Then she made a large fire, and as soon as it was burning well, she threw the pelt into it. It had scarcely begun to burn when a pitiful crying and moaning sounded from within the cave. The girl would have liked to open the cave, but the stone had become too hot, and she would have burned her hands terribly on it. After the fire was out and the stone had cooled off a little, she shoved the stone aside, as best she could. The most handsome prince that one can imagine stood before her. He threw his arms around her neck and cried, "Now do you see that you have redeemed me? You are mine and I am yours, and if your two sisters had been as willing as you, then they would not be dead!"
The prince left the cave with the girl and went to the king's castle and explained everything to him and to the queen. The girl's parents were summoned from the other castle, and he explained everything to them. Three days later they held the wedding with great pomp and ceremony, and one has never seen a more handsome bridegroom than the prince or a more beautiful bride than the girl.
Not long afterward the old king died. The prince came to the throne, and the girl became his queen, and if they have not stood up from throne, then they are still seated upon it.

There was once upon a time a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a piss pot near the sea. Every day the fisherman went out fishing, and he fished a long time. Once he was sitting there fishing and looking into the clear water when his hook went to the bottom, deep down, and when he pulled it out, he had caught a large flounder. Then the flounder said to him, "I beg you to let me live. I am not an ordinary flounder, but an enchanted prince. Put me back into the water, and let me swim."
"Well," said the man, "there's no need to say more. I can certainly let a fish swim away who knows how to talk." Then he put it back into the water, and the flounder quickly disappeared to the bottom, leaving a long trail of blood behind him.
The man then went home to his wife in the piss pot and told her that he had caught a flounder that had told him he was an enchanted prince, and that he had let it swim away. "Didn't you ask for anything first?" said the woman. "No," said the man. What should I have asked for?"
"Oh," said the woman. "It is terrible living in this piss pot. It is filled with stench and filth. Go back and ask for a little hut for us."
The man did not want to, but he went back to the sea, and when he arrived it was all yellow and green, and he stood next to the water and said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will
The flounder swam up and said, "What does she want then?"
"Oh," said the man, "I did catch you, and my wife says that I really should have asked for something. She doesn't want to live in a piss pot any longer. She would like to have a hut."
"Go home," said the flounder. "She already has it."
The man went home, and his wife was standing in the door of a hut, and she said to him, "Come in. See, now isn't this much better." And there was a parlor and a bedroom and a kitchen; and outside there was a little garden with all kinds of vegetables, and a yard with hens and ducks.
"Oh," said the man. "Now we can live well."
"Yes," said the woman, "we'll give it a try."
Everything went well for a week or two, and then the woman said, "Husband. This hut is too small. The yard and the garden are too little. I want to live in a large stone castle. Go back to the flounder and tell him to get a castle for us."
"Oh, wife," said the man. The flounder has just given us the hut. I don't want to go back so soon. It may make the flounder angry."
"I know he can do it," said the woman, "and he won't mind. Just go!"
So, with a heavy heart, the man went back, and when he came to the sea, the water was quite purple and gray and dark blue, but it was still, and he stood there and said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will.
"What does she want then?" said the flounder.
"Oh," said the man sadly, "my wife wants to live in a stone castle."
"Go home. She's already standing before the door," said the flounder.
So the man went home, and his wife was standing in front of a large palace.
"See, husband," she said. "Isn't this beautiful?" And with that they went inside together. There were many servants inside, and the walls were all white, and there were golden chairs and tables in the parlor, and outside the castle there was a garden and a forest a half mile long, and there were elk and deer and rabbits, and there were cow and horse stalls in the yard.
"Oh," said the man, "now we can stay in this beautiful castle and be satisfied."
"We'll think about it," said the woman. "Let's sleep on it." And with that they went to bed.
The next morning the woman awoke. It was daylight. She poked her husband in the side with her elbow and said, "Husband, get up. We should be king over all this land."
"Oh, wife," said the man, "why do you want to be king? I don't want to be king."
"Well, I want to be king."
"Oh, wife," said the man, "how can you be king? The flounder won't want to do that."
"Husband," said the woman, "Go there immediately. I want to be king."
So the man, saddened because his wife wanted to be king, went back. And when he arrived at the sea it was dark gray, and the water heaved up from below. He stood there and said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will.
"What does she want then," said the flounder.
"Oh," said the man, "my wife wants to be king."
"Go home. She's already king," said the flounder.
Then the man went home, and when he arrived at the palace, there were so many soldiers, and drums, and trumpets, and his wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds, and she was wearing a large golden crown and on either side of her there stood a line of maidens-in-waiting, each one a head shorter than the other.
"Oh," said the man, "are you king now?"
"Yes," she said, "I am king."
And after he had looked at her awhile, he said, "It is nice that you are king. Now we don't have to wish for anything else."
"No, husband," she said, "I have been king too long. I can't stand it any longer. I am king, but now I would like to become emperor."
"Oh," said the man, "why do you want to become emperor?"
"Husband," she said, "go to the flounder. I want to be emperor."
"Oh, wife," said the man, "he can't make you emperor. I can't tell him to do that."
"I am king," said the woman, "and you are my husband. Now go there immediately!"
So the man went, and on his way he thought, "This is not going to end well. To ask to be emperor is shameful. The flounder is going to get tired of this." With that he arrived at the sea. The water was entirely black and dense, and a strong wind blew over him that curdled the water. He stood there and said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will.
"What does she want then," said the flounder.
"Oh," he said, "my wife wants to become emperor."
"Go home," said the flounder. "She's already emperor."
Then the man went home, and when he arrived, his wife was sitting on a very high throne made of one piece of gold, and she was wearing a large golden crown that was two yards high, and guards were standing at her side, each one smaller than the other, beginning with the largest giant and ending with the littlest dwarf, who was no larger than my little finger. Many princes and counts were standing in front of her. The man went and stood among them and said, "Wife, are you emperor now?"
"Yes," she said, "I am emperor."
"Oh," said the man, taking a good look at her. "Wife, it's good that you are emperor."
"Husband," she said. "Why are you standing there? I'm emperor now, and I want to become pope as well."
"Oh, wife!" said the man. "Why do you want to become pope. There is only one pope in all Christendom."
"Husband," she said, "I want to become pope before the day is done."
"No, wife," he said, "the flounder cannot make you pope. It's not good."
"Husband, what nonsense! If he can make me emperor, then he can make me pope as well. Now go there immediately!"
Then the man went, and he felt sick all over, and his knees and legs were shaking, and the wind was blowing, and the water looked like it was boiling, and ships, tossing and turning on the waves, were firing their guns in distress. There was a little blue in the middle of the sky, but on all sides it had turned red, as in a terrible lightning storm. Full of despair he stood there and said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will.
"What does she want then?" said the flounder.
"Oh," said the man, "my wife wants to become pope."
"Go home," said the flounder. "She's already pope."
Then he went home, and when he arrived there, his wife was sitting on a throne that was two miles high, and she was wearing three large crowns. She was surrounded with church-like splendor, and at her sides there were two banks of candles. The largest was as thick and as tall as the largest tower, down to the smallest kitchen candle. "Wife," said the man, giving her a good look, "are you pope now?"
"Yes," she said, "I am pope."
"Oh," said the man. "It is good that you are pope. Wife, we can be satisfied, now that you are pope. There's nothing else that you can become."
"I have to think about that," said the woman. Then they both went to bed, but she was not satisfied. Her desires would not let her sleep. She kept thinking what she wanted to become next. Then the sun came up. "Aha," she thought, as she watched the sunrise through her window. "Couldn't I cause the sun to rise?" Then she became very grim and said to her husband, "Husband, go back to the flounder. I want to become like God."
The man, who was still mostly asleep, was so startled that he fell out of bed. "Oh, wife," he said, "go on as you are and remain pope."
"No," said the woman, tearing open her bodice. "I will not be quiet. I can't stand it when I see the sun and the moon coming up, and I can't cause them to rise. I want to become like God!"
"Oh, wife," said the man. "The flounder can't do that. He can make you emperor and pope, but he can't do that."
"Husband," she said, looking very gruesome, "I want to become like God. Go to the flounder right now!"
The man trembled with fear at every joint. Outside there was a terrible storm. Trees and mountains were shaking. The heaven was completely black, and there was thunder and lightning. In the sea he could see black waves as high as mountains, and they were capped with white crowns of foam. He said:
Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!
Flounder, flounder, in the sea!
My wife, my wife Ilsebill,
Wants not, wants not, what I will.
"What does she want then," said the flounder.
"Oh," he said, "she wants to become like God."
"Go home. She is sitting in her piss pot again."
And they are sitting there even today.

A long time ago, many hundreds of years ago, there lived a fisherman with his wife. His name was Dudeldee. They were so poor that they did not have a real house, but lived in a hut made of boards without any windows. They looked out through the knot holes. In spite all this, Dudeldee was satisfied, but not his wife. She wished for this or that and constantly tormented her husband because he could not give it to her.
Dudeldee usually said nothing, thinking only to himself, "If only I were rich," or "If only I could have everything I wished for."
One evening he was standing with his wife before their front door looking around their neighborhood. There were a number of handsome farmhouses nearby. Then his wife said to him, "If we only had a hut as good as the worst of our neighbors' houses. We could have such a one, but you are too lazy. You can't work the way other people work."
Dudeldee asked, "What? Don't I work as hard as other people? Don't I stand there fishing the entire day?"
"No!" answered his wife. "You could get up earlier and catch as many fish before daybreak as you now get during the whole day. But you are too lazy. You don't want to do anything." And thus she scolded him on and on.
So the next morning he got up early and went out to the lake to fish. By the time he saw people going to their fields to work he still had caught nothing. Noon came, and the mowers sat in the shade and ate their noon meals, and still he had caught nothing. Sadly he sat down and pulled his moldy bread from his pocket and ate it. Then he went back to fishing. The sun moved downward, and the mowers went home, the shepherds drove their herds into their enclosures, the cow herds returned home, and the fields grew quiet. But Dudeldee still stood there, and still he had not even one little fish.
It was almost dark when he thought about going home. He would throw out his net just one more time and try to catch something. He threw it out, and as if were trying to lure the fish into it, he called out:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, Hanns Dudeldee?"
asked a little fish that had swum up, sticking his head a little above the water.
Poor Hanns Dudeldee was startled to see the little fish, but he collected himself and thought, "If all I have to do is to want something, you will not have to ask me again."
He looked around to see what he might wish for. On the other side of the lake there stood a handsome palace from which he could hear the beautiful music of horns resounding. At the same time he thought of his wife's wish to have a better house, so he said, "I would like a country house like that one over there. I would like such a palace instead of my little board hut."
"Just go home," said the little fish. "Your board hut is now such a palace."
More running than walking, Hanns Dudeldee returned home. Already at some distance, he saw that at the place where his house formerly stood there was now a splendid palace with brightly illuminated rooms. Entering, he saw that everything was so splendid that he did not know how to behave. The entryway was paved with marble. The living-room floor was of inlaid wood, and polished with wax. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Magnificent chandeliers hung in the high halls. In short, everything was so beautiful that Hans Dudeldee did not dare to walk around inside. He could not believe that this was his property. He thought he had entered the wrong house and would have left, if his wife had not met him on the steps. He had scarcely seen her when he asked her, "Now are you satisfied with the house?" and he told her what had happened.
"What?" she answered. "Do you think that what we have here is a miracle? I saw much better houses in the city when I was in service there. It is passable, but how could you be so stupid? You forgot the best things. Just look at our clothes against this nice house! See how they stand out! At the same time you should have wished for beautiful clothes for me and for you. But you are too stupid and lazy. You don't even make use of the little bit of intelligence that you have." And thus she continued to scold and bicker until she fell asleep.
The next morning at daybreak Hanns Dudeldee went back to the same place, once again threw out his net, and once again called out:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, Hanns Dudeldee?"
Thus replied the little fish once again, and Dudeldee did not have to think long before saying that he wanted beautiful clothing for his wife and for himself, clothing that was appropriate for their new house.
"You have it," said the little fish, and Dudeldee stood there wearing a cloth jacket with gold braid, silk stockings and shoes, and an embroidered vest, everything in keeping with the fashion of the time.
Returning home, he would have scarcely recognized his wife in her silk clothing, but she looked out the window and asked, "Hanns, is that you?"
"Yes," he answered. "Are you satisfied now?"
"We'll see!" she answered.
Thus they lived peacefully for a time. But one day, when her husband wanted to go out fishing again, she said, "Why do you need to go fishing? Give that up and instead wish for yourself a chest filled with gold."
"Hmm, that is true!" thought Dudeldee, and he went out to the lake, once again threw out his net and called out:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, Hanns Dudeldee?"
asked the little fish once again.
"Oh, a chest filled with gold," he said.
"Just go home," said the little fish
And when he arrived home, standing in his bedroom was a chest filled with gold pieces.
Thus they lived high and well. She bought herself a coach and horses, and a riding horse for her husband. They often drove into the cities, and they engaged a cook and servants.
The neighbors always called her the arrogant fishwife. This annoyed her greatly, so she told her husband to make her the ruler over all the neighbors. Once again he went out with his net, threw it into the water, and called out:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, Hanns Dudeldee?"
asked the little fish.
"I would like to be a nobleman or a count and to rule over all my neighbors."
"Just go home. It is so."
When he arrived home the neighbors were paying homage to his wife. She already had had a few of the neighbor women locked up who previously had called her the arrogant fishwife.
Now they often drove to the capital city where the king resided, wanting to join company with other counts. But they did not know how to conduct themselves with the manners of nobility, and everyone ridiculed them. Some countesses would refer to her only as Fish Countess and him as Fish Count Dudeldee.
So she again spoke to her husband, "Go out and have yourself made king. I do not want to be called Fish Countess any longer. I want to be queen."
However, Hanns Dudeldee advised her against this, saying, "Just remember how it was when we were poor, and we wished for a little hut as good as the worst of our neighbors' houses. Now we have a surplus of everything. Let us call it enough."
But his wife did not want to call it enough, and she said, "What? I am to put up with being called Fish Countess? I am to bear the city women's pride? No! They must know who I am. I shall show them! And yet you want to be so simple as to accept all this?" And thus she scolded forth, until he promised to make her queen.
Consequently he went out to the sea, repeated once again his little verse, and the little fish again appeared and again asked, "What do you want, Count Dudeldee?"
He presented the request, that he would like to be king. The little fish said, "You are!"
Returning home, he found that his palace had changed magnificently. It was now much larger. Marshals and ministers with a golden star and golden keys received him with deep bows. His head suddenly became very heavy. He wanted to take off his hat, but behold! Instead of a hat he had a heavy golden crown on his head. And when he saw his wife, he hardly recognized her, so much did her gown glisten with gold and jewels.
When he asked her if she was now satisfied, she said, "Yes, until I once again come to know something better. I would be a fool if I could be better off, and did not do so."
Thus they lived contentedly for a time, and Dudeldee's wife did not wish for anything further, for she had everything that she possibly could want. She had even taken revenge on the countesses who had called her Countess Fish. But finally she came to lack something. She read in the newspaper about the luxury and the expenditures at other kings' courts, and heard that there were other kings and emperors who ruled over many more people and over much more powerful kingdoms than did Dudeldee. Consequently she again approached him, and tormented him until he promised her to become the most powerful king on earth.
Once again he threw out his net, and called out:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, King Dudeldee?"
asked the little fish, and Dudeldee said, "Just make me the most powerful king or emperor on earth." And immediately that is what he was.
When he arrived home ambassadors and deputies from all the kingdoms and all the parts of the earth were there. Poor poets with poems to Atlas awaited him. Schoolmasters who needed better salaries were there with their petitions. Chamberlains, with their hats under their arms, walked back and forth. Peasants engaged in lawsuits wanted an audience. Guards walked up and down. A coach with ten horses, twenty cavaliers, and six couriers was standing there, ready to depart. In an adjacent courtyard there were peacocks and guinea fowls. In short, everything was there that would please such a great emperor. There were even two court jesters who were always near him.
The new Emperor Dudeldee was of course angry that these two foolish people were always following him about wherever he might go, and he complained to his wife about them, for after all, he would rather be in the company of reasonable people than of fools. But she told him that he did not understand. It just had to be that way. All important gentlemen preferred to be with fools. Now he was not going to be a fool himself and make an exception.
Finally he gave in, and was happy that his wife was satisfied, but their happiness did not last long. One day he came to her and found her very sad.
"What is wrong?" he asked her.
"Oh," she said, "I am unhappy about the rainy weather. It has lasted four days now, and I would like to have some sunshine. In fact, I wish that I could do everything that God can do, so that I could have spring and summer and fall and winter exactly when I wanted them."
Thus she spoke to him, and he liked her idea as well. "Why," he thought, "then I could go out in the rain and come home in the sunshine that my wife had made. I could even get rid of the fools." Thinking this to himself, he immediately took his fishing net and slipped out a back entrance into the rain. He went to the sea, threw in his net, and again said, as before:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
"What do you want, Emperor Dudeldee?"
the little fish asked.
"Oh," he said, "only that my wife would like to be able to do whatever God can do: make rain and sunshine, and have spring and summer and fall and winter exactly when she wants them."
"So! Is that all?" asked the little fish. "No, no, Emperor Dudeldee, I see that nothing is good enough for you and your wife. Therefore become the old fisherman Dudeldee once again, for then you were not as proud and unsatisfied as you are now.
Then the little fish disappeared. Hanns Dudeldee called out repeatedly:
"Little fish, little fish, in the sea!"
But no little fish asked:
"What do you want, Hanns Dudeldee?"
And there he stood, as before, without a jacket, wearing only his dirty leather trousers. And when he returned home, the palace was gone. His little board hut was standing there again, with his wife inside in her dirty clothing and looking out through a knothole, as before, and once again she was the wife of Fisherman Dudeldee.

In days long past there lived a poor woodcutter who found life very hard. Indeed, it was his lot to toil for little guerdon, and although he was young and happily married there were moments when he wished himself dead and below ground.
One day while at his work he was again lamenting his fate. "Some men," he said, "have only to make known their desires, and straightway these are granted, and their every wish fulfilled; but it has availed me little to wish for ought, for the gods are deaf to the prayers of such as I."
As he spoke these words there was a great noise of thunder, and Jupiter appeared before him wielding his mighty thunderbolts. Our poor man was stricken with fear and threw himself on the ground.
"My lord," he said, "forget my foolish speech; heed not my wishes, but cease thy thundering!"
"Have no fear," answered Jupiter; "I have heard thy plaint, and have come hither to show thee how greatly thou dost wrong me. Hark! I, who am sovereign lord of this world, promise to grant in full the first three wishes which it will please thee to utter, whatever these may be. Consider well what things can bring thee joy and prosperity, and as thy happiness is at stake, be not over-hasty, but revolve the matter in thy mind."
Having thus spoken Jupiter withdrew himself and made his ascent to Olympus. As for our woodcutter, he blithely corded his faggot, and throwing it over his shoulder, made for his home. To one so light of heart the load also seemed light, and his thoughts were merry as he strode along. Many a wish came into his mind, but he was resolved to seek the advice of his wife, who was a young woman of good understanding.
He had soon reached his cottage, and casting down his faggot: "Behold me, Fanny," he said. "Make up the fire and spread the board, and let there be no stint. We are wealthy, Fanny, wealthy for evermore; we have only to wish for whatsoever we may desire."
Thereupon he told her the story of what had befallen that day. Fanny, whose mind was quick and active, immediately conceived many plans for the advancement of their fortune, but she approved her husband's resolve to act with prudence and circumspection.
"'Twere a pity," she said, "to spoil our chances through impatience. We had best take counsel of the night, and wish no wishes until tomorrow."
"That is well spoken," answered Harry. "Meanwhile fetch a bottle of our best, and we shall drink to our good fortune."
Fanny brought a bottle from the store behind the faggots, and our man enjoyed his ease, leaning back in his chair with his toes to the fire and his goblet in his hand.
"What fine glowing embers!" he said, "and what a fine toasting fire! I wish we had a black pudding at hand."
Hardly had he spoken these words when his wife beheld, to her great astonishment, a long black pudding which, issuing from a corner of the hearth, came winding and wriggling towards her. She uttered a cry of fear, and then again exclaimed in dismay, when she perceived that this strange occurrence was due to the wish which her husband had so rashly and foolishly spoken. Turning upon him, in her anger and disappointment she called the poor man all the abusive names that she could think of.
"What!" she said to him, "when you can call for a kingdom, for gold, pearls, rubies, diamonds, for princely garments and wealth untold, is this the time to set your mind upon black puddings!"
"Nay!" answered the man, "'twas a thoughtless speech, and a sad mistake; but I shall now be on my guard, and shall do better next time."
"Who knows that you will?" returned his wife. "Once a witless fool, always a witless fool!" and giving free rein to her vexation and ill-temper she continued to upbraid her husband until his anger also was stirred, and he had wellnigh made a second bid and wished himself a widower.
"Enough! woman," he cried at last; "put a check upon thy froward tongue! Who ever heard such impertinence as this! A plague on the shrew and on her pudding! Would to heaven it hung at the end of her nose!"
No sooner had the husband given voice to these words than the wish was straightway granted, and the long coil of black pudding appeared grafted to the angry dame's nose.
Our man paused when he beheld what he had wrought. Fanny was a comely young woman, and blest with good looks, and truth to tell, this new ornament did not set off her beauty. Yet it offered one advantage, that as it hung right before her mouth, it would thus effectively curb her speech.
So, having now but one wish left, he had all but resolved to make good use of it without further delay, and, before any other mischance could befall, to wish himself a kingdom of his own. He was about to speak the word, when he was stayed by a sudden thought.
"It is true," he said to himself, "that there is none so great as a king, but what of the queen that must share his dignity? With what grace would she sit beside me on the throne with a yard of black pudding for a nose?"
In this dilemma he resolved to put the case to Fanny, and to leave her to decide whether she would rather be a queen, with this most horrible appendage marring her good looks, or remain a peasant wife, but with her shapely nose relieved of this untoward addition.
Fanny's mind was soon made up: Although she had dreamt of a crown and sceptre, yet a woman's first wish is always to please. To this great desire all else must yield, and Fanny would rather be fair in drugget than be a queen with an ugly face.
Thus our woodcutter did not change his state, did not become a potentate, nor fill his purse with golden crowns. He was thankful enough to use his remaining wish to a more humble purpose, and forthwith relieved his wife of her encumbrance.

There was once an old woman, who was all alone one evening in her cottage, occupied with her household affairs. While she was waiting for her husband, who was away at work over in the forest, and while she was bustling about, a fine, grand lady came in, and so the woman began to curtsy and curtsy, for she had never seen such a grand person before.
"I should be so much obliged if you would lend me your brewing pan," said the lady, "for my daughter is going to be married, and I expect guests from all parts."
Oh, dear, yes! That she might have, said the woman, although she could not remember whether she had ever seen her before, and so she went to fetch the pan.
The lady took it, and thanked the woman, saying that she would pay her well for the loan of it, and so she went her way.
Two days afterwards the lady came back with it, and this time she also found the woman alone.
"Many thanks for the loan," said the lady. "and now in return you shall have three wishes."
And with this the lady left, and vanished so quickly that the old woman had not even time to ask her name or where she lived. But that did not matter, she thought, for now she had three wishes, and she began to think what she should wish for. She expected her husband back soon, and she thought it would be best to wait until he came home and could have a say in the matter. But the least they could wish for must be a fine big farm -- the best in the parish, and a box full of money, and just fancy how happy and comfortable they would be then, for they had worked so hard all their days! Ah, yes, then the neighbors would have something to wonder at, for you may guess how they would stare at all the fine things she would have.
But since they were now so rich it was really a shame that there should be nothing but some blue, sour milk and some hard crusts of bread in the cupboard for her husband when he came home tired and weary, he who was fond of hot food. She had just been to her neighbor's and there she had seen a fine big sausage, which they were going to have for supper.
"Ah, deary me, I wish I had that sausage here!" sighed the old woman; and the next moment a big sausage lay on the table right before her.
She was just going to put it in the pan when her husband came in.
"Father, father!" cried the woman, "it's all over with our troubles and hard work now. I lent my brewing pan to a fine lady, and when she brought it back she promised we should have three wishes. And now you must help me to wish for something really good, for you're so clever at hitting upon the right thing -- and it's all true, for just look at the sausage, which I got the moment I wished for it!"
"What do you mean, you silly old woman?" shouted the husband, who became angry. "Have you been wishing for such a paltry thing as a sausage, when you might have had anything you liked in the world? I wish the sausage were sticking to your nose, since you haven't any better sense."
All at once the woman gave a cry, for sure enough there was the sausage sticking to her nose; and she began tearing and pulling away at it, but the more she pulled the firmer it seemed to stick. She was not able to get it off.
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" sobbed the woman. "You don't seem to have any more sense than I, since you can wish me such ill luck. I only wanted something nice for you, and then -- , oh dear! oh, dear!" and the old woman went on crying and sobbing.
The husband tried, of course, to help his wife to get rid of the sausage; but for all he pulled and tugged away at it he did not succeed, and he was nearly pulling his wife's head off her body.
But they had one wish left, and what were they now to wish?
Yes, what were they to wish? They might, of course, wish for something very fine and grand; but what could they do with all the finery in the world, as long as the mistress of the house had a long sausage sticking to the end of her nose? She would never be able to show herself anywhere!
"You wish for something," said the woman in the midst of her crying.
"No, you wish," said the husband, who also began crying when he saw the state his wife was in, and saw the terrible sausage hanging down her face.
So he thought he would make the best use he could of the last wish, and said, "I wish my wife was rid of that sausage."
And the next moment it was gone! They both became so glad that they jumped up and danced around the room in great glee -- for you must know that although a sausage may be ever so nice when you have it in your mouth, it is quite a different thing to have one sticking to your nose all your life.

Once upon a time there was a king who was the most powerful ruler in the whole world. Kind and just in peace and terrifying in war, his enemies feared him while his subjects were happy and content. His wife and faithful companion was both charming and beautiful. From their union a daughter had been born.
Their large and magnificent palace was filled with courtiers, and their stables boasted steeds large and small, of every description. But what surprised everyone on entering these stables was that the place of honor was held by a donkey with two big ears. However, it was quite worthy of this position, for every morning, instead of dung, it dropped a great load of gold coins upon the litter.
Now heaven, which seems to mingle good with evil, suddenly permitted a bitter illness to attack the queen. Help was sought on all sides, but neither the learned physicians nor the charlatans were able to arrest the fever which increased daily. Finally, her last hour having come, the queen said to her husband: "Promise me that if, when I am gone, you find a woman wiser and more beautiful than I, you will marry her and so provide an heir for throne."
Confident that it would be impossible to find such a woman, the queen thus believed that her husband would never remarry. The king accepted his wife's conditions, and shortly thereafter she died in his arms.
For a time the king was inconsolable in his grief, both day and night. Some months later, however, on the urging of his courtiers, he agreed to marry again, but this was not an easy matter, for he had to keep his promise to his wife and search as he might, he could not find a new wife with all the attractions he sought. Only his daughter had a charm and beauty which even the queen had not possessed.
Thus only by marrying his daughter could he satisfy the promise he had made to his dying wife, and so he forthwith proposed marriage to her. This frightened and saddened the princess, and she tried to show her father the mistake he was making. Deeply troubled at this turn of events, she sought out her fairy godmother who lived in a grotto of coral and pearls.
"I know why you have come here," her godmother said. "In your heart there is a great sadness. But I am here to help you and nothing can harm you if you follow my advice. You must not disobey your father, but first tell him that you must have a dress which has the color of the sky. Certainly he will never be able to meet that request."
And so the young princess went all trembling to her father. But he, the moment he heard her request, summoned his best tailors and ordered them, without delay, to make a dress the color of the sky, or they could be assured he would hang them all.
The following day the dress was shown to the princess. It was the most beautiful blue of heaven. Filled now with both happiness and fear, she did not know what to do, but her godmother again told her, "Ask for a dress the color of the moon. Surely your father will not be able to give you this."
No sooner had the princess made the request than the king summoned his embroiderers and ordered that a dress the color of the moon be completed by the fourth day. On that very day it was ready and the princess was again delighted with its beauty.
But still her godmother urged her once again to make a request of the king, this time for a dress as bright and shining as the sun. This time the king summoned a wealthy jeweler and ordered him to make a cloth of gold and diamonds, warning him that if he failed he would die. Within a week the jeweler had finished the dress, so beautiful and radiant that it dazzled the eyes of everyone who saw it.
The princess did not know how to thank the king, but once again her godmother whispered in her ear. "Ask him for the skin of the donkey in the royal stable. The king will not consider your request seriously. You will not receive it, or I am badly mistaken." But she did not understand how extraordinary was the king's desire to please his daughter. Almost immediately the donkey's skin was brought to the princess.
Once again she was frightened and once again her godmother came to her assistance. "Pretend," she said, "to give in to the king. Promise him anything he wishes, but, at the same time, prepare to escape to some far country.
"Here," she continued, "is a chest in which we will put your clothes, your mirror, the things for your toilet, your diamonds and other jewels. I will give you my magic wand. Whenever you have it in your hand, the chest will follow you everywhere, always hidden underground. Whenever you wish to open the chest, as soon as you touch the wand to the ground, the chest will appear.
"To conceal you, the donkey's skin will be an admirable disguise, for when you are inside it, no one will believe that anyone so beautiful could be hidden in anything so frightful."
Early in the morning the princess disappeared as she was advised. They searched everywhere for her, in houses, along the roads, wherever she might have been, but in vain. No one could imagine what had become of her.
The princess, meanwhile, was continuing her flight. To everyone she met, she extended her hands, begging them to find her some place where she might find work. But she looked so unattractive and indeed so repulsive in her Donkey Skin disguise that no one would have anything to do with such a creature.
Farther and still farther she journeyed until finally she came to a farm where they needed a poor wretch to wash the dishcloths and clean out the pig troughs. They also made her work in a corner of the kitchen where she was exposed to the low jokes and ridicule of all the other servants.
On Sundays she had a little rest for, having completed her morning tasks, she went to her room and closed the door and bathed. Then she opened the chest, took out her toilet jars and set them up, with the mirror, before her. Having made herself beautiful once more, she tried on her moon dress, then that one which shone like the sun and, finally, the lovely blue dress. Her only regret was that she did not have room enough to display their trains. She was happy, however, in seeing herself young again, and this pleasure carried her along from one Sunday to the next.
On this great farm where she worked there was an aviary belonging to a powerful king. All sorts of unusual birds with strange habits were kept there. The king's son often stopped at this farm on his return from the hunt in order to rest and enjoy a cool drink with his courtiers.
From a distance Donkey Skin gazed on him with tenderness and remembered that beneath her dirt and rags she still had the heart of a princess. What a grand manner he has, she thought. How gracious he is! How happy must she be to whom his heart is pledged! If he should give me a dress of only the simplest sort, I would feel more splendid wearing it than any of these which I have.
One day the young prince, seeking adventure from court yard to court yard, came to the obscure hallway where Donkey Skin had her humble room. By chance he put his eye to the key hole. It was a feast-day and Donkey Skin had put on her dress of gold and diamonds which shone as brightly as the sun. The prince was breathless at her beauty, her youthfulness, and her modesty. Three times he was on the point of entering her room, but each time refrained.
On his return to his father's palace, the prince became very thoughtful, sighing day and night and refusing to attend any of the balls and carnivals. He lost his appetite and finally sank into sad and deadly melancholy. He asked who this beautiful maiden was that lived in such squalor and was told that it was Donkey Skin, the ugliest animal one could find, except the wolf, and a certain cure for love. This he would not believe, and he refused to forget what he had seen.
His mother, the queen, begged him to tell her what was wrong. Instead, he moaned, wept and sighed. He would say nothing, except that he wanted Donkey Skin to make him a cake with her own hands.
"O heavens," they told her, "this Donkey Skin is only a poor, drab servant."
"It makes no difference," replied the queen. "We must do as he says. It is the only way to save him."
So Donkey Skin took some flour which she had ground especially fine, and some salt, some butter and some fresh eggs and shut herself alone in her room to make the cake. But first she washed her face and hands and put on a silver smock in honor of the task she had undertaken.
Now the story goes that, working perhaps a little too hastily, there fell from Donkey Skin's finger into the batter a ring of great value. Some who know the outcome of this story think that she may have dropped the ring on purpose, and they are probably right, for when the prince stopped at her door and looked through the key hole, she must have known it. And she was sure that the ring would be received most joyfully by her lover.
The prince found the cake so good that in his ravishing hunger, he almost swallowed the ring! When he saw the beautiful emerald and the band of gold that traced the shape of Donkey Skin's finger, his heart was filled with an indescribable joy. At once he put the ring under his pillow, but his illness increased daily until finally the doctors, seeing him grow worse, gravely concluded that he was sick with love.
Marriage, whatever may be said against it, is an excellent remedy for love sickness. And so it was decided that the prince was to marry.
"But I insist," he said, "that I will wed only the person whom this ring fits." This unusual demand surprised the king and queen very much, but the prince was so ill that they did not dare object.
A search began for whoever might be able to fit the ring on her finger, no matter what the station in life. It was rumored throughout the land that in order to win the prince one must have a very slender finger. Every charlatan had his secret method of making the finger slim. One suggested scraping it as though it was a turnip. Another recommended cutting away a small piece. Still another, with a certain liquid, planned to decrease the size by removing the skin.
At last the trials began with the princesses, the marquesses and the duchesses, but their fingers, although delicate, were too big. for the ring. Then the countesses, the baronesses and all the nobility presented their hands, but all in vain. Next came the working girls, who often have slender and beautiful fingers, but the ring would not fit them, either.
Finally it was necessary to turn to the servants, the kitchen help, the slaveys and the poultry keepers, with their red and dirty hands. Putting the tiny ring on their clumsy fingers was like trying to thread a big rope through the eye of a needle.
At last the trials were finished. There remained only Donkey Skin in her far corner of the farm kitchen. Who could dream that she ever would be queen?
"And why not?" asked the prince. "Ask her to come here." At that, some started to laugh; others cried out against bringing that frightful creature into the room. But when she drew out from under the donkey skin a little hand as white as ivory and the ring vas placed on her finger and fitted perfectly, everyone was astounded.
They prepared to take her to the king at once, but she asked that before she appeared before her lord and master, she be permitted to change her clothes. To tell the truth, there was some smiling at this request, but when she arrived at the palace in her beautiful dress, the richness of which had never been equaled, with her blonde hair all alight with diamonds and her blue eyes sweet and appealing and even her waist so slender that two hands could have encircled it, then even the gracious ladies of the court seemed, by comparison, to have lost all their charms. In all this happiness and excitement, the king did not fail to notice the charms of his prospective daughter-in-law, and the queen was completely delighted with her. The prince himself found his happiness almost more than he could bear. Preparations for the wedding were begun at once, and the kings of all the surrounding countries were invited. Some came from the East, mounted on huge elephants. Others were so fierce looking that they frightened the little children. From all the corners of the world they came and descended on the court in great numbers.
But neither the prince nor the many visiting kings appeared in such splendor as the bride's father, who now recognized his daughter and begged her forgiveness.
"How kind heaven is," he said, "to let me see you again, my dear daughter." Weeping with joy, he embraced her tenderly. His happiness was shared by all, and the future husband was delighted to find that his father-in-law was such a powerful king. At that moment the fairy godmother arrived, too, and told the whole story of what had happened, and what she had to tell added the final triumph for Donkey Skin.

A rich widower had an only daughter who was developing into a beautiful and charming woman. Her father's heart became inflamed with impure love, but she withstood his advances. He threatened to force himself on her, and she responded with cunning. She promised to yield to his will if he would give her a dress made of silver. When she received such a dress, she then demanded one made from gold, and the third time, one made from jewels. After receiving that one as well, she said, "Now all I need is a crow-skin coat," and then she made one last wish: a magic wand. These too she received.
Now in another land there lived a prince who had heard of the girl's beauty. Taking the magic wand in her hand and the dresses over her shoulder, she wished herself to the vicinity of the prince's castle. She immediately found herself in the castle garden. Then she wished for herself a chest in an oak tree in the garden, put her dresses in it, put on the crow-skin coat and went to the castle kitchen where she presented herself as a poor boy looking for work.
"I can use you," said the cook. "You can be the cinder blower."
A few days later the prince came to the kitchen with some freshly killed game. She saw him and liked him beyond measure.
Soon afterward there was a wedding in a nearby castle, and the prince went to it. Many people went there to look on at the dance. Cinder Blower asked the cook for permission to observe. She ran to the oak tree, put on the silver dress, and wished herself a carriage in which she rode to the castle. The prince saw her and danced with her, but after a few dances she disappeared. Seating herself in her carriage she said,
Darkness behind me, Before me light,
So none can follow me into the night.
The next morning the prince was in a bad mood, for he had been awake all night thinking about his beautiful dance partner. Cinder Blower was asked to polish his boots, and this she did, but she failed to polish one small spot on one of the toes. The prince noticed this and angrily came into the kitchen and threw the boot at her head.
The next evening there was another dance, and Cinder Blower again asked for permission to go. This time she put on the golden dress, then rode there in the carriage. The prince had been looking for her and was very happy when she arrived. While dancing with her he asked her where she lived.
"In Boot-Throw" was her answer. She remained there one hour, and then disappeared. In vain the prince asked where Boot-Throw was. No one could tell him.
Again that night the prince could not close his eyes, and the next day he was in an even worse mood than before.
Cinder Blower was asked to brush his coat, but he did not like the way she did it, and finally he threw the brush at her head.
The third evening Cinder Blower again asked for permission to look on at the dance, then put on her dress of precious stones. While dancing with her the prince asked her where she lived.
"In Brush-Throw," was her answer.
"Whoever you are," he said, "take this ring from me."
She let him put the ring onto her finger. Then she tried to sneak away, but the prince carefully watched her and followed close behind her. She climbed out of her carriage near the oak tree. However, she did not have time to take off her dress, but quickly put on the crow-skin coat over it.
The next morning when the cook was preparing the soup, Cinder Blower dropped the ring into it. The prince found it and asked the cook who had been in the kitchen.
"Only Cinder Blower and I," he answered.
The prince summoned Cinder Blower and said, "My head itches. Look and see if any vermin are there."
Cinder Blower obeyed, but when she stood before him, he saw the diamond dress glistening forth from beneath the worn-out crow-skin coat. Then he recognized her. "Now you are mine," he said, and he made her his wife and they lived happily together until they died.

n a castle there once lived a count by the name of Rudolf. His wife had a golden cross on her forehead. Their daughter Adelheid had the same mark on her forehead. When she was twenty years old her mother suddenly died.
The count's and his daughter's sorrow and grief were endless. After the mother's burial, the father and his child locked themselves in their rooms and were seldom seen.
After a month had passed, the count had his daughter brought to his room and said to her, "Dear child, you know how much I loved your mother. I cannot live without a wife. Therefore I am going out into the world to seek a wife who -- like your blessed mother -- has a golden cross on her forehead. If I do not find such a woman within a year and a day, then I will marry you."
When Adelheid heard these words she was very upset, and she silently withdrew. The next morning Count Rudolf departed, promising to return within a year and a day.
When Adelheid was alone she considered whether or not it would be possible for her father to find a woman with such a cross. Then she remembered that her mother had once told her that except for her and Adelheid, no one on the entire earth had such a cross.
She decided to go away. She would rather earn her bread with the work of her own hands than to eat the finest tidbits at her father's table as his wife. She entrusted one of her loyal servants with her plan, and they made preparations to depart.
She secretly loaded her valuables, her jewelry, her gold, and her clothes into several large carriages. During the night she drove off with them, accompanied by her servant Gotthold and several others who were loyal to her. They came to a large city where she rented a house and moved into it with her servants.
Adelheid had often stated that she wanted to earn her bread with the work of her own hands. Therefore Gotthold sought a position for his mistress in the city. He learned that there was an opening for a kitchen maid in the castle of Prince Adolf. Thus he went to the chief cook and asked him if he would be willing to hire his niece, for that is what he called the countess. As he talked further with the chief cook, Gotthold recognized in him a friend whom he had not seen for many years. He told him that his brother had died, leaving a daughter in his care. The chief cook agreed to hire her.
The loyal servant happily returned to the countess and remained in the rented house.
Adelheid now dyed her face, neck, and hands brown; covered her golden cross and her hair with a large head-scarf; took off her magnificent robes, putting on instead old, dirty, torn clothing; and presented herself to the chief cook.
She was given a small room where she could sleep and keep her things. Slowly she grew accustomed to her job, even though she was exhausted by the hard work.
Until now she had not yet seen the prince. One day he invited all his friends and acquaintances to a great ball. On the morning of the ball, Adelheid was sweeping the staircase, when the prince, without being seen by her, walked up and tipped over the dust pail, thus dirtying his boots. As she was fleeing he angrily ripped the broom from her hands and threw it at her.
That evening as the hall was filling with people, the young countess went to the chief cook and asked him for permission to go to the ball.
He replied, "No, I cannot allow you to do that. What if the prince were to find out!"
Adelheid continued to beg, until he finally said, "Just go. But don't stay too late, and if you get anything, bring some back for me as well."
Now she went to Gotthold's house, changed her clothes, washed away the color, and ordered up a splendid carriage in which she rode to the prince's.
When the guests saw the splendid carriage approaching in the distance they all hurried outside and said, "A foreign lady! A beautiful lady!"
The prince hurried toward her, lifted her from her carriage, and led her up the stairs. She had to dance with him the entire evening and to sit next to him at the table. After eating, he asked her what her name was and where she came from.
"My name is Adelheid, and I come from Broomthrow," replied the countess.
At twelve o'clock she left, and with her the majority of guests.
Arriving at home she quickly got undressed, colored herself brown, and took three gold pieces which she gave to the chief cook, claiming that she had stood behind a door and had received the gold from an old woman.
The next morning the prince looked for Broomthrow on his maps, but he could not find it. He wanted to ask her about her home city once again, but because he did not know where she lived he invited his friends to a second ball.
On the morning of the second ball Adelheid was brushing her clothing when the prince, without being seen, came up the stairs. She turned around and dropped the brush, which fell onto the prince's feet. Angrily Adolf picked up the brush and threw it at the embarrassed countess's head.
That evening the chief cook once again allowed her to go the ball, and she took advantage of his permission. At the ball Adolf told her that he had not been able to find Broomthrow.
"How could you be looking for Broomthrow?" she replied. "I said Brushthrow."
Once again they danced together, and as midnight approached she went home. She brought the chief cook a gold band, claiming that she had received it as a gift.
The next morning the prince looked for Brushthrow, but could not find it. He then invited his friends and acquaintances to a third ball, which was to be even more magnificent than the first two.
On the eve of the ball, shortly before the festivities were to begin, Adelheid, contrary to custom, was combing her hair in the castle. The prince, displeased because the foreign lady had not arrived yet, walked up the stairs just as the countess dropped her comb. Prince Adolf picked it up and threw it at the kitchen servant's head. She quickly withdrew, changed her clothes, and went to the ball.
At the table the prince said that he had not been able to find Brushthrow anywhere.
"I can believe that," she said. "I called the place Combthrow." He didn't want to believe her, but she argued with him until he finally gave in. Before she left he placed a ring on her finger, without her noticing it.
The next morning the prince was not well, and he asked a chief cook to make soup for him. The latter announced this in the kitchen, and Adelheid asked for permission to make the soup. But he said, "If you put something in the soup that doesn't belong there, then I am the one who will be punished."
She replied, "I will not put anything wrong in it." She made the soup, and without being seen, she threw the prince's ring into the soup.
The prince poured the soup into a dish and heard something jingle. He felt around and fished out the ring. Amazed, he then asked who had made the soup.
"The kitchen maid" was the answer.
Adolph ordered his servant, "Bring her here."
She hurriedly put on the dress that she had worn the previous evening, and when the prince saw her, he recognized his dance partner. She now had to tell him her life story, and soon afterward he married her.
In the meantime her father had come home, and when he discovered that his daughter had already married, he had to accept his fate.

There was a king before now, and he married, and he had but one daughter. When his wife departed, he would marry none but one whom her clothes would fit. His daughter one day tried her mother's dress on, and she came and she let her father see how it fitted her. It was fitting her well. When her father saw her he would marry no woman but her.
She went crying where her muime was; and her foster mother said to her, "What was the matter with her?"
She said, "that her father was insisting that he would marry her."
Her muime told her to say to him, "that she would not marry him till he should get her a gown of the swan's down."
He went, and at the end of a day and a year he came, and the gown with him.
She went again to take the counsel of her muime. "Say to him," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he gets thee a gown of the moorland canach."
She said this to him. He went, and at the end of a day and year he returned, and a gown of the moorland canach with him.
"Say now to him," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he brings thee a gown of silk that will stand on the ground with gold and silver."
At the end of a day and year he returned with the gown.
"Say to him now," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he brings thee a golden shoe, and a silver shoe."
He got her a golden shoe and a silver shoe.
"Say to him now," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him unless he brings thee a kist that will lock without and within, and for which it is all the same to be on sea or on land."
When she got the kist, she folded the best of her mother's clothes, and of her own clothes in it. Then she went herself into the kist, and she asked her father to put it out on the sea to try how it would swim. Her father put it out; when it was put out, it was going, and going, till it went out of sight.
It went on shore on the other side; and a herd came where it was, intending to break it, in hopes that there were findings in the chest.
When he was going to break it she called out, "Do not so, but say to thy father to come here, and he will get that which will better him for life."
His father came, and he took her with him to his own house. It was with a king that he was herd, and the king's house was near him.
"If I could get," said she, "leave to go to service to this great house yonder."
"They want none," said the herd, "unless they want one under the hand of the cook."
The herd went to speak for her, and she went as a servant maid under the hand of the cook.
When the rest were going to the sermon; and when they asked her if she was going to it, she said, "that she was not; that she had a little bread to bake, and that she could not go to it."
When they went away, she took herself to the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the down of the swan. She went to the sermon, and she sat opposite the king's son. The king's son took love for her. She went a while before the sermon skailed, she reached the herd's house, she changed her clothes, and she was in before them. When the rest came home, it was talking about the gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were.
The next Sunday they said to her, "Was she going to the sermon?" and she said, "that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."
When they went away, she reached the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the moorland canach; and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat opposite to him. She came out before them, and she changed, and she was at the house before them; and when the rest came home, it was talking about the great gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were.
The third Sunday, they said to her, "Was she going to the sermon?" and she said, "that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."
When they went away, she reached the herd's house. She put on the gown that would stand on the ground with gold and silver, and the golden shoe and the silver shoe, and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat where he was. A watch was set on the doors this Sunday. She arose, she saw a cranny, and she jumped out at the cranny; but they kept hold of one of the shoes.
The king's son said, "Whomsoever that shoe would fit, she it was that he would marry."
Many were trying the shoe on, and taking off their toes and heels to try if it would fit them; but there were none whom the shoe would fit.
There was a little bird in the top of a tree, always saying as everyone was trying on the shoe, "Beeg beeg ha nan doot a heeg ach don tjay veeg a ha fo laiv a hawchkare." -- Wee wee, it comes not on thee; but on the wee one under the hand of the cook.
When he could get none whom the shoe would fit, the king's son lay down, and his mother went to the kitchen to talk over the matter.
"Won't you let me see the shoe?" said she. "I will not do it any harm at all events."
"Thou! thou ugly dirty thing, that it should fit thee." She went down, and she told this to her son.
"Is it not known," said he, "that it won't fit her at all events? And can't you give it her to please her?"
As soon as the shoe went on the floor, the shoe jumped on her foot.
"What will you give me," said she, " to let you see the other one?" She reached the herd's house, and she put on the shoes, and the dress that would stand on the floor with gold and silver. When she returned, there was but to send word for a minister, and she herself and the king's son married.

At an early period, when a plurality of kings reigned in Scotland, it chanced that one of them had lost his queen; and one of the queens had lost her husband. These two, the widow and widower were married, each of them having had a daughter in their first marriage, it caused a good deal of dissention and strife, particularly as the king's daughter was a perfect model of beauty, and the queen's daughter as much so of deformity; but the king willing to indulge his queen as much as possible, and for the sake of keeping peace in his own house, he often winked at the bad treatment his daughter received from her stepmother, all because she was more handsome and fair than her beloved but ugly daughter. Her treatment was however so very bad, that she was put to herd her father's cattle; while the queen's daughter wallowed in all the luxuries of a court endowed with peace and plenty. Rashen Coatie, (for so shall the king's daughter be called), having her meat, which was of the coarsest fare, brought her by the queen's favourite daughter daily, she had learned from some kind fairy how to charm her asleep when partaking of her food, which she did on her immediate arrival, by repeating the following words:
Lay down your head upon my knee,
And well looked after it there shall be,
Then sleep ye one eye or sleep ye two,
Ye soon shall see what power can do.
These words had the desired effect of lulling her sound asleep, which no sooner took place than a genii in the shape and form of a calf, brought her meats and dainties of every description, of which she partook heartily, unknown to all but her favourite calf.
The queen being now wearied with trying all the arts that mischief could devise, to bring Rashen Coatie's beauty to a level with her daughter's; or to raise her daughter's beauty to that of Rashen Coatie's; thought she must have some hidden means of subsistence, as all the stratagems she tried were always attended with want of success.
On consulting her henwife, who was a witch, how she should behave in this critical juncture; the witch said she would give her an eye in her neck, by which sight she would be able to discover many things, particularly how Rashen Coatie was fed and maintained without her perceiving it. Accordingly the queen went next day to the castle to discover Rashen Coatie's friends, and discovered how she was fed, owing to an omission of Rashen Coatie's. She found that it was the calf that fed her, which made her long to get it destroyed.
The king though loath to deprive his daughter of her only companion, her favourite calf, he was obliged to comply with the queen's imperious demands, in order to suppress the wrangling and strife which were daily taking place among his domestics, particularly by his queen. Rashen Coatie having discovered the queen's intention, mourned over her ravenous appetite, with streaming eyes and bleached cheeks. The calf having the power of speech, requested her not to be alarmed at what was to take place, but to gather together all the bones into one mass, and place them beneath a particular stone, and in a short time they would revive and come to life again. This having been done as commanded, everything came to pass as predicted by the calf; and the malicious queen having partook of the entrails of the calf, lingered and died of a disease hitherto unknown in that part of the country. Her daughter now became of contempt, despised and hooted by everyone.
Rashen Coatie's sun now began to shine in meridian splendour; she was gentle and mild, humble to everyone, which gained her the esteem and good will of both great and small. Her beauty having kept pace with her virtue, her father took such a liking to her, as to wish to marry her; but this being quite contrary to her principles of sound morality, she grew melancholy, every day more and more, and lingered out a weary existence, till having met with her calf, she asked it what was best to be done under such pressing difficulties.
The calf advised her to ask from her father a gown and petticoat made of the rashes that grew on the bonny burn side, in which she was to be drest. This having been accomplished; she then requested of him to give her a dress composed of all the colours of the birds of the air. This also having been given her; she demanded a new suit of variegated colours, composed of all those appearances that float in the air, and in the earth beneath. Having obtained all these varieties; she had now no excuse but to comply with her father's wishes, which were to accompany him to the altar, where all things were ready for the marriage ceremony.
Having thus far complied with his wishes, she went, but on arriving at the place appointed, she started back, exclaiming, that she had forgotten her marriage ring. Her father, to prevent her returning home, said he had one which would answer the purpose perfectly well; but she insisted on having her mother's ring, and must needs return for it, but promised to be back in a few minutes.
Again, she had recourse to the advice of her calf, which was to dress herself in her rashen weed, and to leave her father's kingdom with all speed. This was accordingly done, and she wandered far till she came to a hunting lodge, kept by the prince of that country. Here she made free to enter, and go to the prince's bed to rest her wearied limbs, which had undergone much toil and fatigue in the course of a long and laborious travel. When the prince came to his lodge, he was surprised to find a sleeping beauty in his bed, as it was in a sequestered part of his kingdom, where few inhabitants were to be found.
She soon made her escape from him, and went to his father's palace, where she asked a place as a menial servant, which was granted, and thereby put into the kitchen to assist the cook in turning the spits which groaned with the weight of the meat that was roasting for their majesties' dinner. Here she continued for some time, doing all the drudgery of the meanest servant. Christmas, however, came on, when great preparations were made for church.
Rashen Coatie also wished to appear among the rest, but was denied permission by the master cook. But it so happened that, on the first yule day, when all were gone, and she left alone in the kitchen to attend the meat, she said to the spits, peats, and pots, to do their duty till she returned; which was accordingly done. The words of the charm which she made use of on this occasion were as follows:
Every spit gar another turn,
Every peat gar another burn,
Every pot gar another play
Till I return on good yule day.
These did as desired; when she went and dressed herself in rich attire. On arriving at the church, she placed herself in a conspicuous part of the seat, nearly opposite to where the young prince was sitting. He caught more of the flame of love than of the minister's spiritual exhortations, and could scarcely contain himself from making enquiries during the sermon. She went in the same manner all the holy days of yule, but every day more and more superbly drest. The prince at length determined on discovering her rank and place of abode, if possible, little thinking that it was his own menial, Rashen Coatie, as her history seemed to be a mystery to everyone.
The term of her secrecy seemed to be now at end; for hurrying home on the last day, she dropped one of her shoes, which were so completely fitted to her feet, that it was supposed it would suit no one else. The prince, on having found the shoe, which was of pure gold, caused to be proclaimed throughout all the regions of his father's kingdom round about, that everyone should have free liberty to try on the shoe, and whomsoever the shoe fitted best, was to be his bride.
Many trials were made, but all to no purpose, till the henwife's daughter caused her heels and toes to be pared; by which process she got it forced on her foot. Agreeably to the proclamation, it therefore became the prince to marry her, with which he was to comply, but with a heavy heart.
On their way to the marriage seat, a small bird fluttered over their heads, crying as they went:
Clipped heels and pared toes.
They're in the kitchen the shoe on goes.
The prince hearing the voice of the bird, requested to know its meaning, when it was explained. With joy he returned to his father's castle, much against the henwife's inclination, when it was found that Rashen Coatie, who hurkled in the kitchen, had not got an opportunity of trying on the shoe. On presenting her with the shoe, it went easily on, but what was more to their surprise and astonishment, she pulled out its fellow, and put it on before them. They, of course, we need not add, were immediately married, and lived long and happy. Shortly after the marriage, they paid a visit to her father's court in great pomp and grandeur, by whom they were most cordially received, and his kingdom, at his death, bestowed on them.

There was once a queen that was left a widow with one daughter, who was as good and handsome as any girl could be. But her mother wasn't satisfied to remain without a husband; so she married again, and a very bad choice she made. Her second husband treated her very badly; and she died soon after. Well, would you ever think of the widower taking it into his head to marry the young princess at the end of a year? She was as shocked as she could be when he made her the offer, and burst out a crying.
"I took you too sudden," said he. "Sleep on it, and you can give me an answer tomorrow."
She was in great trouble all the rest of the day, and when the evening came she went out into the paddock, where a beautiful filly she used to ride was grazing. "Oh my poor beast! " said she, "I'm sure if you knew my trouble you'd pity me."
"I do know your trouble, and I pity you, and I'll help you too," says the filly. "I'm the fairy that watched over you from the time you were born, and I am here near you since your mother married the second time. Your stepfather is an enchanter, but he'll find me too strong for him. Don't seem shocked when he'll ask your consent tomorrow, but say you must have first a dress of silk and silver thread that will fit into a walnut shell. He'll promise, and will be able to get it made too, but I'll bother his spinner and his weaver long enough before he'll get it wove, and his seamstress after that, before it's sewed."
The princess done as she was bid, and the enchanter was in great joy; but he was kept in great trouble and anger for a full half year before the dress was ready to go on the princess. At last it was fitted, and he asked her was she ready to be his wife.
"I'll tell you tomorrow," said she.
So she went to consult her filly in the paddock. Well, the next day he put the question to her again, and she said that she couldn't think of marrying anyone till she had another dress of silk and gold thread that would fit in a walnut shell.
"I wish you had mentioned itself and the silver dress together. Both could have been done at the same time. No matter. I'll get it done."
Whatever trouble the spinner and the weaver and the seamstress had with the other dress, they had twice it with this; but at last it was tried on, and fitted like a glove.
"Well now," says Fear Dhorrach, "I hope you're satisfied, and won't put off the wedding again."
"Oh, you must forgive me," said she, "for my vanity." She was talking to the filly the evening before. "I can't do without a dress of silk thread as thick as it can be with diamonds and pearls no larger than the head of a minnikin pin. Three is a lucky number, you know."
"Well, I wish you had mentioned this at first, and the three could be making together. Now this is the very last thing you'll ask, I expect."
"Oh, I'll never ask another, you may depend, till I'm married."
She didn't say till we're married.
The dress came home at last. Well, the same evening she found on her bed another made from bottom to top of cat-skins, and this she put on. She put her three walnut shells in her pocket, and then stole out to the stable, where she found her filly with a bridle in her mouth, and the nicest side-saddle ever you saw on her back. Away they went, and when the light first appeared in the sky they were a hundred miles away.
They stopped at the edge of a wood, and the princess was very glad to rest herself on a bunch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. She wasn't a minute there when she fell asleep; and soundly she did sleep, till she was woke up by the blowing of bugles and the yelping of beagles. She jumped up in a fright. There was no filly near her, but half a hundred spotted hounds were within forty perches of her, yelling out of them like vengeance.
I needn't tell you she was frightened. She had hardly power to put one foot past the other, and she'd be soon tore into giblets by the dogs on account of her dress, but a fine young hunter leaped over their heads, and they all fell back when he shook his whip and shouted at them. So he came to the princess, and there she was as wild looking as you please, with her cat-skins hanging round her, and her face and hands and arms as brown as a berry, from a wash she put on herself before she left home. Well that didn't hinder her features from being handsome, and the prince was astonished at her beauty and her color and her dress, when he found she was a stranger, and alone in the world. He got off his horse, and walked side by side with her to his palace, for he was the young king of that country.
He sent for his housekeeper when he came to the hall door, and bid her employ the young girl about whatever she was fit for, and then set off to follow the hounds again.
Well, there was great tittering in the servants' hall among the maids at her color and her dress, and the ganders of footmen would like to be joking with her, but she made no freedom with one or the other, and when the butler thought to give her a kiss, she gave him a light slap on the jaw that wouldn't kill a fly, but he felt as if a toothache was at him for eight and forty hours. By my word, the other buckeens did not give her an excuse to raise her hand to them. Well, she was so silent and kept herself to herself so much, that she was no favorite, and they gave her nothing better to do than help the scullery maid, and at night she had to put up with a little box of a place under the stairs for a bedroom.
The next day, when the prince returned from hunting, he sent word to the housekeeper by the whipper-in to let the new servant bring him up a basin and towel till he'd wash before dinner.
"Oh, ho!" says the cook, "there's an honor for Cat-Skin. I'm here for forty years and never was asked to do such a thing; how grand we are! purshuin to all impedent people!"
The princess didn't mind their jibes and their jeers. She took up the things, and the prince delayed her ever so long with remarks and questions, striving to get out of her what rank of life she was born in. As little as she said he guessed her to be a lady. I suppose it is as hard for a lady or gentleman to pass for a vulgarian, as for one of us to act like one of the quality.
Well to be sure! all the cold and scornful noses that were in the big kitchen before her; and it was, "Cat-Skin, will you hand me this? Cat-Skin, will you grease my shoes? Cat-Skin, will you draw a jug of beer for me?" And she done everything she was asked without a word or a sour look.
Next night the prince was at a ball about three miles away, and the princess got leave from the housekeeper to go early to bed. Well, she couldn't get herself to lie down. She was in a fever like; she threw off her outside dress, and she stepped out into the lawn to get a little fresh air. There what did she behold but her dear filly under a tree. She ran over, and threw her arms round her neck, and kissed her face, and began to cry.
"No time for crying!" says the filly. "Take out the first walnut shell you got."
She did so, and opened it.
"Hold what's inside over your head," said the other, and in a moment the silk and silver dress wrapped her round as if a dozen manty-makers were after spending an hour about it.
"Get on that stump," says the filly, "and jump into the side-saddle."
She did so, and in a few minutes they were at the hall door of the castle where the ball was. There she sprung from her saddle, and walked into the hall. Lights were in the hall and everywhere, and nothing could equal the glitter of the princess's robes and the accoutrements of her steed. It was like the curling of a stream in the sun.
You may believe that the quality were taken by surprise, when the princess walked in among them as if they were the lords and ladies in her father's court. The young king came forward as he saw the rest were a little cowed, and bade her good evening and welcome; and they talked whatever way kings and queens and princesses do, and he made her sit on his own seat of honor, and took a stool or a chair near her, and if he wasn't delighted and surprised, her features were so like the scullery maid's, leave it till again.
They had a fine supper and a dance, and the prince and she danced, and every minute his love for her was increasing, but at last she said she should go. Every one was sorry, and the prince more than anyone, and he came with her to the hall, and asked might he see her safe home. But she showed him her filly and excused herself.
Said he, "I'll have my brown horse brought, and myself and my servants will attend you."
"Hand me up on my filly," says she, " first of all," and, be the laws, I don't know how princes put princesses on horseback. Maybe one of the servants stoops his back, and the prince goes on one knee, and she steps first on his knee and then on the servant's back, and then sits in the saddle. Anyhow she was safe up, and she took the prince's hand, and bid him good night, and the filly and herself were away like a flash of lightning in the dark night.
Well, everything appeared dismal enough when he went back to where a hundred tongues were going hard and fast about the lady in the dazzling dress.
Next morning he bid his footman ask the girl in the cat-skin to bring him hot water and a towel for him, to shave. She came in as modest and backward as you please; but whenever the prince got a peep at her face, there were the beautiful eyes and nose and mouth of the lady in the glittering dress, but all as brown as a bit of bogwood. He thought to get a little talk out of her, but dickens a word would come out of her mouth but yes or no.
And when he asked her was she of high birth, she turned off the discourse and wouldn't say one thing or the other; and when he asked would she like to put on nice clothes and be about his mother, she refused just as if he asked her to drown herself. So he found he could make nothing of her, and let her go down stairs.
There was another great ball in a week's time, and the very same thing took place again. There was the princess, and the dress she had on was of silk and gold thread, and the darlintest little gold crown in the world over her purty curling hair.
If the prince was in love before, he was up to his eyes in it this time; but while they were going on with the nicest sweet talk, says she, "I'm afraid, prince, that you are in the habit of talking lovingly to every girl you meet."
Well, he was very eager to prove he was not.
"Then," said she, "a little bird belied you as I was coming through the wood. He said that you weren't above talking soft even to a young servant girl with her skin as brown as a berry, and her dress no better than cat-skin.''
"I declare to you, princess," said he, "there is such a girl at home, and if her skin was as white as yours, and her dress the same, no eye could see a bit of differ between you."
"Oh, thankee, prince!" says she, "for the compliment; it's time for me to be going."
Well, he thought to mollify her, but she curled her upper lip and cocked her nose, and wasn't long till she left, the way she did before. While she was getting on her filly, he almost went down on his knees to her to make it up.
So at last she smiled, and said, "If I can make up my mind to forgive you, I'll come to the next ball without invitation."
So she was away, and when they came under the tree in the lawn she took the upper hem of her dress in her fingers and it came off like a glove, and she made her way in at the hack door, and into her crib at the stair-foot.
The prince slept little that night, and in the morning he sent his footman to ask the girl in the cat-skins to bring up a needle and thread to sew a button on his shirt sleeve. He watched her fingers, and saw they were small and of a lovely shape; and when one of them touched his wrist, it felt as soft and delicate as silk.
All he could say got nothing out of her only, "It wasn't a nice thing for a prince to speak in that way to a girl of low degree, and he boasting of it after to princesses and great ladies."
Well, how he did begin to deny anything so ungenteel, but the button was sewed, and she skipped away downstairs.
The third night came, and she shook the dress of silk and pearls and diamonds over her, and the nicest crown of the same on her head. As grand and beautiful as she was before, she was twice as grand now; and the lords and ladies hardly dared to speak above their breaths, and the prince thought he was in heaven. He asked her at last would she be his queen, and not keep him in misery any longer, and she said she would, if she was sure he wouldn't ask Miss Cat-Skin the same question next day.
Oh, how he spoke, and how he promised! He asked leave to see her safe home, but she wouldn't agree.
"But don't be downcast," said she. "You will see me again sooner than you think; and if you know me when you meet me next, we'll part no more."
Just as she was sitting in her saddle, and the prince was holding her hand, he slipped a dawny limber ring of gold on one finger. It was so small and so nice to the touch he thought she wouldn't feel it.
"And now, my princess," says he to himself, "I think I'll know you when I meet you."
Next morning he sent again for the scullery girl, and she came and made a curtchy.
"What does your majesty want me to do?" said she.
"Only to advise me which of these two suits of clothes would look best on me; I'm going to be married."
"Ah, how could the likes of me be able to advise you? Is the rich dressed lady, that I heard the footmen talking about, to be your queen?"
"Yourself is as likely to be my wife as that young lady."
"Then who is it?"
"Yourself, I tell you."
" Myself! How can your majesty joke that way on a poor girl? They say you're promised to the lady of the three rich dresses."
"I'm promised to no one but yourself. I asked you twice already to be my queen; I ask you now the third time."
"Yes, and maybe after all, you'll marry the lady of the dresses."
"You promised you'd have me if I knew you the next time we'd meet. This is the next time. If I don't know you, I know my ring on your fourth finger."
She looked, and there it was sure enough. Maybe she didn't blush.
"Will your majesty step into the next room for a minute," said she, "and leave me by myself?"
He did so, and when she opened the door for him again, there she was with the brown stain off her face and hands, and her dazzling dress of silk and jewels on her.
Wasn't he the happy prince, and she the happy princess? And weren't the noisy servants lewd of themselves when they saw poor Cat-Skin in her royal dress saying the words before the priest? They didn't put off their marriage, and there was the fairy now in the appearance of a beautiful woman; and if I was to tell you about the happy life they led, I'd only be tiring you.
